rockylee,6-Oct," rocky,  i'm not going to give you a lesson on economics and try to convince you to buy a bmw.thank-you. i guess habitat, i'm partial pal with gm, because most of my family has worked for them and delphi.dad, and a few remaining relatives took the early buy-out at the end of july after 27 yrs. i still have a few family members left on the gm and delphi payroll. i'm not on bmw's marketing payroll and i don't care what you drive. vice- nissan  i'm sure.that is correct again. i'm just glad you aren't interested in  car  made with cheap labor by child slaves. at least bmw's for the most part are made by people that are paid a livable wage and most are union-made and i can respect that pal.  but i will share my personal experience and why i don't ever see financially soph toyota icated buyers flocking from bmw (or lexus, or acura or..) to cadillac.for the most part you are correct. cadillac has rebounded itself. i agree they need get that interior down to european levels to have a chance at regaining market-share.from 1987 to 1995 i owned a acura  acura . initial cost $12,600. retired to salvation army in 1995 w/ 127k miles.  those were fun to drive  car . like a go-kart, my buddy had a gs-r coupe a mid 90's model  ifrom 1995 to present i own a nissan  nissan . initial cost $20,500. retired from primary duty in 2004, but still alive and kicking at 155k miles. nissan 's are nice. they were a big player in the mid-90's. they have redone the interior very nicely, what last year ? perhaps there is a gm/cadillac model that you would find attractive to own for the next 10 years.i used to swap  car  often, but now i like to hold on to them for at least 3 years. i'm going to buy at least my wifes grandma's 2000 buick  buick  for $4k. she passed away a couple of months ago. it has like 70k on it. it will be my future work car. my grandmother has a 2002 oldsmobile aurora, with 43k and she is willing to sell it to me for $10k. i think i'm going to buy it also for the wife and kids. that's below trade in value. i'm going to pay cash for both.  i have a seriously difficult time renting a gm for 10 days on business.getting the low-end models must stink. for me, the value of a  bmw , or any number of other really well built and well engineered  car , is that they can last 10-15 years - and still be enjoyable to drive at the end of that time.i completely understand. gm, in the past they built some very horrible  car . i know why you are so skeptical about the future. in my eyes i'm finally seeing action, instead of just promises from gm. i as you know post alot. i spend alot of time gathering the newest inside secrets i can, and like posting links on edmunds. especially when it has something to do with gm.if you buy high quality that lasts, at a fair price, you will almost always be ahead of buying low quality at a cheaper price. agree  gm has a long h toyota ory of producing vehicles that, after 5 years, hardly anyone wants to own. they might have the ability to last 150k miles, but if they weren't already killing you with squeaks and rattles when they were new, they certainly will by the 5 year mark.agree. however i'm beginning to see changes. the 2004'  pontiac  was the beginning of change and signs of quality. it didn't sell well because of style. the lucerne is another nice piece of quality. now we have the new suv's cuv's trucks, and you gotta agree that was a huge quality jump from the previous generation. habitat, take a saturn  saturn  sometime when you get a chance for a test drive. it's not like you are obligated to buy it. how bout those kappa twins ?  i seriously doubt even you would find a 5+ year ownership experience desirable.off the top of my head the aurora's, 95-99 riviera were both rock solid. my former 02' cadillac seville sts was rock solid also. but yeah, for the most part you are correct unfortunately.i'm sure gm would have something with another 100 lbs of torque to get your blood going. and you'd be stuck trying to find someone who finds a 4-5 year old caddy an attractive car. they may be out there where you live, but they sure aren't in my neighborhood.yes cadillacs, are very popular around here. lots of conservative people around here. they like domestics especially the trucks and suv's (mainly gm) michigan, otoh the conservatives like japananese, and domestics, kinda weird to me. :surprise:so in summary, i don't fault you for liking gm. that's your prerogative. and, i certainly don't fault you for thinking $40k is expensive. i made the same as you when i bought that  acura  and thought, at the time, that a $20k  acura  was too much.$40k i think is alot of money, no matter how much you make. if i was a millionaire it would still be a good chunk of change. i hope gm, can make a car that even somebody like you would like to own someday. but i would respectfully suggest that true build quality and long term value are not things that should be dismissed in favor of leather and torque. and that's where imo, bmw will continue to shine over gm. they do shine, and have a huge fan base. people who can and can't afford but both desire them the same. i've always respected bmw's  car . it's not like they are pos's. they are true-blue german engineered. even i was close to pulling the trigger on a very low mileage 97' black  bmw  sedan last year.  got a question, i sat in my buddy's 97'  bmw  sedan in the back seat. is the  bmw  as roomy as it in the back seat ???? how much will the 400 hp  bmw  be ? will the sedan be the same price as the coupe ???? (if you know by chance?)p.s. in 1988 i bought a fixer upper house in a good neighborhood that i stretched for. this month, i'll send in the final mortgage payment. it's current market value is about as much as our 911s ... plus a 911 turbo, cayenne turbo, and carrera gt combined. hey rich guy, if you ever come to texas, you need to look me up and give me a ride in your 911s :p ne ways congrats on paying your home off. i bet that felt good.  too bad my generation will never be able to get a   ""  kia hyundai affordable  ""  kia hyundai  home. they are so out of line with prices. :mad: dad, and grandpa told me it use to be that the rule of thumb was to not buy more house than 1-weeks net pay. now they say 2 weeks and if your spouse has a job 3 weeks. :surprise: i know i'm much younger than you, but is my generation insane or what habitat ????so don't feel too bad for your friends that put money into a house instead of a caddy... or a bmw... or even an acura  acura . that is true, but some of them are buying the cadillac of houses.... one's they really can't afford. i think if you looked around you'd agree. house + car doesn't=job :confuse:rocky "

kdshapiro,6-Oct," tough question. you're talking to a person who buys extended maintainence on reliable japanese products. i would get the extended maintenance agreement on a bmw also.i would also not use the three of four opinions here as a benchmark for the reliability of any manufacturer.repairing a lexus and bmw for a similiar problem will have similiar costs.  toyota ting a brake job on a 4year old 335 vs a 4 year old  toyota , will obviously have very different costs associated with it. if you believe the extended warranty will cover the areas prone to failure the extended warranty is a good deal.

captain2,6-Oct," entry level luxury performance sedan? don't know that you can classify 'entry' without also talking price - is 50k+ for a 530, e350, or a gs meet all defintions of what most folks consider a 'luxury sports sedan' sure -- entry level not for most folks. is even the small 330 pushing the price envelope. probably. so really what you are left with are a few suitably powered fwd  car  and a notable exception, the  pontiac 5. and then, the dilemma, how can any car with 60% or more of its weight over its drive wheels be a true performance car. acura has tried hard with the tl, ending up with ride sacrifices while still not eliminating the understeer endemic to the weight imbalance and the torque steer common to many well powered fwd  sedan . ditto for things like  nissan s,  chevrolet  ss/gp.for my part, ending up with an  toyota  touring after shopping both the tl and  pontiac 5, the  toyota  and tl both at about 30k the  pontiac 5 a few thousand more. the  pontiac 5 definitely the only one that i would define as a performance car, it is a hoot to drive but at the price of the fit/finish and luxury levels found in the tl/ toyota . the tl, a muuch rougher ride - the  toyota  the surprise i didn't anticipate - a car that will run with either of the other two (until the road gets really curvy), much larger and more  toyota able, trading off some of that 'handling' for a far better ride. the touring model definitely the trim line of choice, more tightly sprung and perhaps a little more 'fun'. not sure though that 6 second 0-60 or 100 mph quarters necessarily makes it a 'performance' sedan though - don't think that is possible in a fwd car. "
kdshapiro,6-Oct," the tl rougher than the  pontiac 5? i disagree. but it goes to show you have the drive the  car  yourself and not rely on someone elses opinion. i'm glad you like the  toyota , it is way too big for my taste. and you hit the nail on the head with the disclaimer...once you hit the curves. lots of  car  do well in a straight line.you are on target on price. is350 the same as the 335, tl coming in at about $34, with the base  pontiac 5 at $30kish. of course no one will ever get a base  pontiac 5.

captain2,6-Oct," my purchase in the spring of 05 - both the tl and the  pontiac 5 were hot sellers, the tl with maybe a 6-7% discount, the  pontiac 5 about the same, the  toyota  which i knew nothing about wasn't even on dealer lots yet and selling closer to sticker. curse for those of us that end up wanting finer  car  - demand has a way of keeping prices closer to sticker - could have gone to any of those 'detroit' brands and gotten one of those 538%  discounts. anyway the tl was the car i thought i wanted and was going to be about 30k no nav, the  pontiac 5 to bring in up to the tl level needed a 3500.00 option package, the  toyota  also 30k simlarily equipped to the tl. can understand the comment about size, the  toyota  certainly has a lot of that, the power and fe to boot, but a sports sedan it ain't.  pontiac 5 certainly qualifies, my contention that it is the only truly 'entry level' sports sedan currently available unless you want to consider throw things like the evo/ subaru  into the mix, but then i guess where is the 'luxury'.

pg48477,6-Oct," here is my experience with bmw&#146;s, i never had a problem with my 3 and so as my two friends, one of them also owned 525 and it was also trouble free. my other friend hase 530 and it&#146;s in the shop once a month, he is a big bmw freak and would get another one, no questions ask. so, i would say if it breaks few times in the first year or so; you&#146;ll have  problem  with this car and if reliability is a big issue for you, you will not be happy. on the other hand if the car has no  problem  in the beginning, you should not have any issues in the future.p.s. 3 is the most reliable out of all  bmw , i would be  toyota able with owning one.

pg48477,6-Oct, how did you figured that? 
blueguydotcom,6-Oct," how did i figure it?pretty simple math:330i - msrp of 43k. i negotiated a sale price of 39.9k. if i bought the car that'd be 44k out the door.my lease was 485 a month for 36 months, for a total of 17.4k. at lease return my model was selling for 24k but the residual was 24.6k. that's a 19.6k hit.i see a $2200 difference there (not including loan interest if i didn't buy the bmw for cash). "
pg48477,6-Oct," still don&#146;t get why you use 44k as price if you buy and 39.9 if you lease. taxes aside and lets say the selling price after 3 years is 24, would make the difference of 15.9 (39.9-24). to make it fair you should use the same selling price for both lease and buy. at the end of the day, lease is more due to interest, all things being equal. p.s. i too prefer to lease but found it more expensive then buying for cash and then trading the car in for a new one. "
blueguydotcom,6-Oct," still don&#146;t get why you use 44k as price if you buy and 39.9 if you lease.if buy you pay taxes. if you lease you pay taxes on the portion you use. so, when i compare the two options, taxes play a huge role. buy the car, you're down 44k, lease the car and you pay only taxes on the portion you use.taxes aside and lets say the selling price after 3 years is 24, would make the difference of 15.9 (39.9-24).no. you have to pay the taxes. no way around it. not sure what planet you're on but if you buy a 40k car, you're paying those taxes up-front. p.s. i too prefer to lease but found it more expensive then buying for cash and then trading the car in for a new one.no way. if you negotiate a crappy lease, sure. but given bmw's propped up leasing model, i come out ahead easily on leasing. bmw overvalues their  car  residuals and usually gives you a decent mf. bimmers lose about 20% of their value in year 1 - taxes included because you can't avoid paying them on a purchase.secondly, trading in a car you lose even more. that's giving thousands away. trading-in a car you're talking about another 2-3k difference in price from private-party resale. trade-in value of my 03 330i was hovering in the low 20s. i woulda taken a bath: as will any person who trades-in a late-model car to a dealership. "
pg48477,6-Oct," well, i guess we are on two different planets. if you trade in your car you only pay tax on the difference, therefore the tax you overpaid on the first purchase will go back to you after the trade in. second, the residual value after 3 year lease is very close to trade in, for bmw that is. and please don&#146;t quote me k toyota  or edmunds as they are not even close on some models and makes. i spend my share on dealers auctions and i can assure you bmw in a good condition will bring good money. i can see you are very passionate about leasing and ed, there is no need to get upset if you perfect deal is not so perfect. just go back to planet earthjagain, if you lease you always pay more, at lease the money factor if you are good negotiator. "
captain2,6-Oct," you point out a few of the reasons why leasing a car is very rarely if ever reflective of the actual price paid. other factors that allow for an 'apparently' good price include finance charge buydowns, something relatively new called 'market equalization' fees, adjsutable mileage allowances and fees, residual adjustments relative to the anticipated 'damages' done to the car at lease end. there is a reason why dealers prefer leasing - it is easier for them to get approved and much more profitable for them. not to mention all those low mileage 'prog dodge '  car  they get back to make even more of a killing on!could never understand the logic of leasing unless, of course, you really don't drive much or really want a new car every 3 years or so. many of my friends have  car  on leases and will usually brag about that fictious lease 'sales' price, and then find halfway thru the lease or so that they can't use the car nearly as much as they want to, and ultimately are hit with mileage and/or damage chargebacks at lease end that forces the refinance of the residual on an actual purchase for several thousand more than what the car is really worth. or is all rolled into another lease - a self-perpetuating problem, that sooner or later, has to be bought out of.in any event, although a good lease can minimize your monthly out-of-pocket, it will never be cheaper than an actual purchase, and a cash price remains really the only way to determine a car's actual sell price. and you are right, the only thing that dealers like better than late model trades is the service depts. - this is where they really make their money. "
pg48477,6-Oct," just one more point, in case of the lease bank owns the car not the dealer. in most cases the bank will sell the car on the dealers auction, the price they get will eventually make up residual % you get at the purchase. so, in real life residual value equals the price on the dealers auction (or in other words &#147;trade in&#148;). in case of bmw bank, they usually charge low money factor, therefore their residuals are very accurate, otherwise they&#146;ll lose money, and trust me bank will never loose their money.not replying directly to you captain2, just continuing the trail. "
jtla,6-Oct," also not replying to you, p pontiac 8477, just continuing this thread.the true financial advantage on leasing comes from, as blueguydotcom pointed out, the saving on sales tax. unfortunately, even this saving is often largely offset by the so-called acquisition fee ($600-$900) up front and termination fee ($350 to $600) at lease end. in some states, sales tax is levied on the selling price of the vehicle.leasing can be a better deal than purchasing only when there is factory subsidy that is not available/applicable to purchase (for example, artificially high residual). otherwise, lease is almost always more expensive than purchase. the reason is plain and simple: no dealer or bank would share with you the cost of ownership of a vehicle. "
mikefm58,6-Oct," one more note here on this, where leasing is a definite advantage is if the vehicle is used as part of a business, such as a realtor or other sales person. there are d toyota inct tax advantages of leasing versus an outright purchase for commercial vehicles.but for individuals, leasing is   ""  kia hyundai virtually 100%  ""  kia hyundai  more expensive in the long run over a purchase. "
circlew,6-Oct," i agree that lease is cheaper than the depreciation hit in re-sale value. my lease is 12,000 miles/3yrs. and will probably go for $800 for extra miles 4 months before lease end. the extra cost for lease vs. buy is because you need to lease twice vs. buying and keeping 6 years.if you buy and keep the car over 6 years, you probably are flirting with 100k so depreciation levels out in the later years but basically the maintenance/repair costs increase fast. the resale is low and hit is high vs. original cost.the savings in buying comes after year 6 but the car is basically getting tired in at least some major drive train parts. but if the car stays sound, you start saving in repair costs.

rockylee,6-Oct," i bet they are getting near retail for the  bmw , right ?rocky "
captain2,6-Oct," if you buy and keep the car over 6 years, you probably are flirting with 100k so depreciation levels out in the later years but basically the maintenance/repair costs increase fast. the resale is low and hit is high vs. original cost any car these days should have minimal maintanence costs at 6 yrs/72000 miles, if that is the assumption on miles driven and length of loan. unless, of course, you are driving something like a bmw or mb, which owners should trade off before the warranty/free service periods expire.a friend had an older 328 (before bmw had to offer their service prog dodge ). nothing really wrong with the car, took it in for the 40000 mile 'scheduled' service and got it back $2300.00 later - absurd - since when do 'simple' brake jobs cost $1200.00 and 'simple' tuneups $600.00! although the german  car  do maintain high values used, the gross dollar hit is ludricrous compared with most of the 'japanese' makes - the reason why the lease rates tend to be much higher. but, in any case - most of the real money saved by purchasing is actually realized after the vehicle is paid off, so that from a financial standpoint it does make sense to accelerate that process as much as possible, even if your monthly bill is doubled.

blueguydotcom,6-Oct," well, i guess we are on two different planets. if you trade in your car you only pay tax on the difference, therefore the tax you overpaid on the first purchase will go back to you after the trade in.that's dependent on state. in ca your trade-in does not count for squat on taxes. trade in a 40k car for a 40k car and you're still down 4k on taxes. second, the residual value after 3 year lease is very close to trade in, for bmw that is.i've owned a couple  bmw  now. there's a pervasive myth they don't lose much value. and please don&#146;t quote me k toyota  or edmunds as they are not even close on some models and makes. i spend my share on dealers auctions and i can assure you bmw in a good condition will bring good money. not from what i see.  bmw  lose insane amounts of value quickly. after year 3, like everything else, the slide slows.again, if you lease you always pay more, at lease the money factor if you are good negotiator.ba toyota le that's just ignorant. i've proven you wrong already... you're talking but not making any sense. you're using terms like   ""  kia hyundai always  ""  kia hyundai  and yet you don't seem to understand them. my last lease, i saved thousands leasing.  chevrolet ly because the car took a huge hit on depreciation and the tax savings.

blueguydotcom,6-Oct," even without ed you can get them for a bit over invoice. people are really myopic about saving some dough. say you're in some po-dunk fly-over-state and the one bmw dealership won't budge on price. check bimmer boards and find a large  honda  nearby that does have competition. some email blasting will nail down deals quickly. hop a jetblue, ted, swa flight after you do the deal online/over-the-phone and pick up your car for a quick drive back. if that'll get you a bmw at $500-1000 over invoice v. mrp, that's worth it. living in socal we've got bmw dealerships on all over. there's so much competition that a car like the  bmw  starts getting negotiated prices below msrp before they're ever delivered. "
louiswei,6-Oct," oh, blueguy, i am pretty sure the  bmw  are flying out of the dealer lot with price below msrp. like i  toyota d, usually the edmunds' tmvs are off for some reason. i wouldn't be surprised to find out that the  bmw  are selling for about $1000 under msrp. i know for people like you that's not that great of a deal but compare to many suckers whom are paying msrp that's not that bad at all - especially for a hot car like  bmw .i agree with you on that if people truly want to land a great deal they should shop around the coutry. when i bought my is350 back in april i found out that i can get probably another $1000 to $1500 off the deal i got in atlanta if i buy it from dealers in cali. however, with the school and many interviews lining up back them, a trip to cali to pick up the car just seems not logical to me. also, since i was planning to finance my car for at least 4 years, $1000 difference (about 20 dollars per month) is just not that significant after all. the bottom line is: would i want to get a better deal than the one i got ($1500 off msrp)? yes. but after taking everything into consideration, it seems more reasonable for me to buy it from my local dealership. "
habitat1,6-Oct," two comments:(1) i agree that you need to draw the value line somewhere when it comes to saving money. my business partner, with a net worth in the solid 8 figure range, considered importing a honda  honda  from canada a few years ago to save an extra $1,000 on the exchange rate. needless to say, he's a great lawyer and investor in our company, but i handle the financial decisions. that example aside, i have found it unnecessary to go accross country or outside the country to do a little arbitrage bargaining.(2) leasing vs. buying: blueguydotcom may be an exception, but i always seem to have the strongest negotiating position when i can write a check for an in-stock car and dare the dealer to rip it up. edmunds tmv on my 2002 s2000 was $36,000 (yes, $3,200 over msrp). the saturday before thanksgiving in 2001, i walked out with one for $32k even. the discount on my 2005 911s cab was even more substantial. at one year and 10,000 miles, i could sell it for, at worst, $8-9,000 less than i paid for it (about 50% of what the annual lease payments would be). i am in a lucky state that recognizes trade in values on taxes. i am of the general opinion that when you introduce another party to a transaction - i.e. a leasing company or financial institution - they need to make money to stay in business. if, in fact, they have a cost of capital that is significantly below mine, they might be able to do that and still offer me some value in return. but, for a lot of people, that internal cost of capital could be a 6%-7% home equity loan, with the interest being tax deductible. that's hard to beat. "
blueguydotcom,6-Oct," habitat, dealers make less money if you pay cash for a car. it's actually a better deal for them to sell the car lower and get you on their financing. the bank pays them back instantly and they get a cut of the finance rate. actually had a dealership tell me straight up if i financed through them and then paid off the loan instantly they'd sell me the car at a lower price. weird but true.i totally agree that quite often leasing for the short-term buyer quite often really isn't a great deal without a tax deduction. but there are exceptions.

""  kia hyundai replay what you are saying. if the dealer makes more money if a buyer finances a car, that must mean the buyer is paying so much in financing costs as to allow the fiancing company to give a kickback to the dealer. and i agree, that may be the case. but when my cost of funds is under 4% after tax, i sure as hell am not going to pay 8%+ on a car loan or a lease money factor that translates to that kind of interest rate.i haven't tried the idea of financing a car so the dealer gets his cut up front and then paying the loan off immediately thereafter. but i suspect the financing company would get wise to this tactic pretty quickly and put the kabosh on it. or have a substantial pre-payment penalty / loan fee to the buyer to cover the kickback.it's pretty simple, really. there is only one source of revenue in this equation - you the buyer. how many businesses do you want to support with your revenues? i don't even deal with sales people any more and, surprise, always get a better deal directly from the sale manager by cutting out that middle person. again, i think we agree there are particular circumstances in which you can game the system to your advantage. i wouldn't mind sticking it to a finance company if it didn't cost me anything and the dealer gave me a piece of their kickback. but the payoff needs to be good enough or the free cocktails strong enough for me to spend a couple of hours with finance guy that probably struggled through high school math.

drewsrx,6-Oct," just recently, i got a chance to check out the new  pontiac 5 sport. i have to admit, it is a very spectacular overall package. it really feels more like a sports car than the previous version, yet it is also more refined and luxurious. the interior is far better than the first generation with higher quality materials and fit/finish.the engine is smoother, more powerful, and has more top end. the handling feels more secure and less twitchy than the previous car. like the previous version, high-speed driving is a pleasure. i am really looking forward to trying out the 6-speed manual, but those will not be here for a while. i have not had a chance to drive the new  bmw  sedan to see how it compares, but hopefully will be able to soon. although there will be a substantial price difference between the two, it will be interesting to see how these  car  compete with one another. between the bmw-3 and infiniti-g, one can't go wrong.

dougiex,6-Nov, wait for the 2008  pontiac 5 coupe !the 335 will look dull in comparison both inside and out and the performance will blow it away as well. the design of the 335 is dull even without comparing it side by side with anything else.note that the 335 is only a 3.0 l engine and its turbocharged too :-) for only 300hp. the 2007  pontiac 5 sedan is already more than hp than the  bmw . naturally the coupe will be more ( 330+) naturally aspirated. the current vq engine in the 2006 coupe can produce well over 400hp turbocharged if you really want power.before you make your final decision and by a bmw just for the name make sure you properly test drive both  car  because the hype about bmw handling is way overrated in my opinion. trust me i really test drive the bmw and  pontiac 5 3 years ago when i bought my coupe. each time when i test drive the  car  sales person was sorry they came along for the drive because they are not used to driving these  car  even close to their limits themselves. in the end the  pontiac 5 coupe was a clear winner to me so much so that i could not help myself but to buy one.

stl540,6-Nov," i test drove the 2007  pontiac 5s  infiniti  and  bmw  sp  infiniti  yesterday. here are my opinions.exterior (subjective area that i will not get into): pontiac 5s - i like the updated looks of the  pontiac 5 compared to the previous gen bmw  &#150; i also like the looks of the  bmw . winner &#150; draw (too subjective)interior: pontiac 5s - the interior is also improved over the previous gen. some of the interior plastic looks somewhat cheap, but taking the lower price into consideration, it looks fine. the interior is a nice improvement over the previous gen. the sport  seat  were  toyota able, and the thicker steering wheel felt nice. i would have to get used to hvac and radio controls, but they seem to be in a good position. i did find myself trying to turn up the radio with the temperature dial. again, my un mazda rity was the cause. bmw  &#150; higher quality materials than the g. i do not care for the placement of the driver side window controls. cup holders are odd, but functional. bmw is not known to provide good solutions for cup holders. hvac and radio control were good. winner &#150; slight favor to bmw in terms so quality feel. slight favor to g in terms of gadgets (hard drive for mp3, backup camera, cf capable, etc). engine: pontiac 5s - i like the growl of the engine. it is powerful at higher rpms. it did not have the same pull at lower rpms as the  bmw . once the rpms got up there, it pulled well. the lack of low-end torque was noticeable on the g. bmw  &#150; engine sound was good. slight (very slight) turbo lab. the torque is awesome at all rpms (starting around 1500 rpm). the car was powerful at any rpm. i was very, very impressed with the pull at any speed. felt like a v8.winner:  bmw . tranny: pontiac 5s - i expected this to be wonderful, but i was disappointed. the shifter vibrated way too much at all rpms, even at idle. it vibrated so much; i did not want to have my hand near it unless i needed to shift. the salesman told me this was normal. other than that, the tranny shifted well. bmw  &#150; shifted well. it did not have the uncontrolled vibrations like the g. winner:  bmw handling: pontiac 5s - the car handled well. it required more effort to keep in line with more aggressive driving. i am sure the suspension is capable of good performance, but imo it will also take more work on the driver&#146;s part to get there. the use of a lsd is a nice feature compared to the  bmw . the stability control system shut down too hard when the wheels broke loose. bmw  &#150;it goes where you point it with little effort. i felt more in control of the car in nearly all situations. the stability control is much improved over previous gens. it did not shutdown the engine power as hard or easy as the previous gens or as the g. i also really like the feature where you can push the dtc button to allow more wheel slippage while still have the stability control kick in if the car gets completely out of control. this feature is not available in the g. winner &#150;  bmw msrp price:winner -  pontiac 5s &#150; the price is ~$8k lower than the  bmw .residual value: winner &#150;  bmw  &#150; 4% higher resale than the g &#150; bmw only costs $1640 more over 3 years (if car was sold at the stated residuals). this is much less than the $8k initial price diff of msrp. the cost difference will be higher (an adv for the  pontiac 5) if finance changes are factored in to my calc. $45k * .61 = $27,450 resale after 3 years &#150; total depreciation = $17,550 $37k * .57 = $21,090 resale after 3 years &#150; total depreciation = $15,910maintenance: winner bmw &#150; no cost for 4 year/50k miles  pontiac 5s  toyota ted cost over 50k miles using the factory recommended service interval&#149;	3700 mile oil changes - $30/each = $390 for 13 oil changes&#149;	$300 service at 15k miles&#149;	$700 service at 30k miles&#149;	$300 service at 15k miles&#149;	$400 brakes at 30k miles &#150;  toyota ted need&#149;	total = $2090 over three years & 45k milestco: draw: the 3 year tco is nearly the same if finance charges are factored in. beyond 3 years is unknown (at least by my quick calculations)i do not have an allegiance to a particular marquee. the comments above are my opinions. my final conclusion is the bmw is the better alternative for me. the  pontiac 5 is a nice performing car and would be able to my needs for a high performance car if the  bmw  was not available. the driving  toyota mics in the bmw is much better (again, imo) that i can justify the initial price difference. my s toyota er-in-law and two friends have the g and love it. i am more of a driving enthusiast than them.my advice to others is to test drive both and buy the one that fits your driving style better. do not  ford  on 0-60 and other stats because this is not normal driving. the stats offer a quick comparison, but there is much more to a car&#146;s performance than running stop light to stop light.cheers!

cbanct,6-Nov," excellent review !i am sure many edmunds fans will appreciate your thoughtful input. my assesment after driving both  car  is similar. most peolple would be happy in either car. however, the d toyota inguishing part is what i call the wow or smile factor.if you love to drive, then the  bmw  is the car. it makes me feel like a better driver, because it handles so well. i find myself smiling when driving the  bmw . the pull when hitting the gas is exhilarating. the exhaust note on the  bmw  is music!the electronics in the  bmw  is nowhere close to the  pontiac 5. if i decide to get the  bmw  i would have to get an after market navigation like the pioneer systems. i wonder where the best place is to have this installed ? there are some concerns with the  bmw , such as the run flat tires. i did not compare ster volkswagen . has anyone done that ?cbanct "
allargon,6-Nov, i agree with all the above except the resale part. i've noticed the 3 series resale values taking exceptionally hard 1st year hits lately with all these redesigns and renumberings. i know you based it on the residuals. i'm curious what the numbers will actually be in a year or so.

dynamos,6-Nov," my 2 cents. i purchased a 07  pontiac 5 with premium and auto. it was $11k less than a comparably equipped  bmw . while bmw does give you free maintenance, they only change the oil every 15k miles, which turns out to be only about 3 service visits over 48k miles. even with the synthetic oil i was never  toyota able with the long service interval. also, having owned both bmw and infiniti, i will take the reliability of infiniti over bimmer any day. further, infiniti provides a 70k powertrain warranty compared to only 50k at bmw. also, my experience is dealer service is much better from infiniti--who provide a loan car for any service. getting a service loaner at bmw is always a hassle. "
stl540,6-Nov," congrats on the new g. the three recommended visits over 45k miles for the  bmw  is a wonderful thing. time is precious and spending unnecessary time at a dealer is not appealing to me.i was also hes toyota ant on the l5k service interval. i posted the lab results of an oil change of my 540i a couple years ago. here is the link: stl540,   ""  kia hyundai bmw  bmw   sedan   ""  kia hyundai  #8770, 18 apr 2004 5:03 pm!keywords=allin%3amsgtext%20limit%3abmw%3 audi %2520series%20stl540%20oil%20change. the results exceeded my expectations and would lead one to believe that the engineers actually know what they are talking about.  i am surprised that infiniti still recommends 3700 oil changes when many (if not most) manufacturers recommend 7k+ service intervals. some car companies have been recommending a 15k mile interval over 7 years with success.neither infiniti nor bmw are known to be as reliable as honda or toyota. they both have their share of issues as they both push the envelope on technology much more than hon or toy. i have examples (some personal) on good and bad experiences of infiniti and bmw. i had some major mechanical issues with my 540i outside of warranty. fortunately my dealer was able to get them covered for me. a friend of mine who owns a 2003  pontiac 5 had his car in the shop quite a bit. i also have friends with bmw's and infiniti's with higher mileage with minimal issues.my bmw dealer has been wonderful. i have a bmw loaner for any service visit. it definitely makes the experience much better. glad to hear your infiniti dealer treats you right.happy driving. enjoy the car.

dynamos,6-Nov," stl540: thanks for the thoughful reply. as far as honda reliability, honda/acura( honda /tl) has experienced major automatic transmission issues over the last few years, but have been able to keep the news quiet. i had a honda person comment to me(tongue-in-cheek) that they were having workers comp issues because of all of the mechanics back injuries caused from lifting the transmissions. also, toyota ( toyota ) has had   ""  kia hyundai sludge  ""  kia hyundai  issues, but has also kept that out-of-the press. i owned a 740i which caused me to get to know the bmw service personnel way too well.  "
stl540,6-Nov," i experienced a tranny failure in our 2002 acura  acura  at 78k miles. i was quoted $3500 to replace. the dealer stated the never see tranny failures of the beloved acura brand. i took the car with me and did research (needless to say, i was not happy). it was not hard to find many others who experienced tranny failures on honda/acura for my 2000-2002 around 60k to 80k by doing a quick google search.after becoming more educated, i pushed back on the dealer and they got honda to pay for parts and i paid for labor ($800). i was happy with the outcome, but not happy with the 'we never see this happen' remark. i personally know at least 4 other people who experienced tranny failures around 60k-80k on honda/acura.we purchased another honda for my wife...a 2006 'mom mobile' (hope she does not read this comment  ). besides the tranny failure, the acura was rock solid until we sold it at 90k miles. i expect the  honda  to do the same, w/o the tranny issue (fingers crossed).

nyccarguy,6-Nov," congrats on the purchase of your new  pontiac 5. enjoy it. i've yet to see a new one on the road, but i like what i see in the pictures.there has been lots of debate for  bmw  long service intervals. i know the reccomended service intervals have been lengthened since bmw started paying. that being  toyota d, bmw engineers are very smart people and i'm sure ther 15,000 mile  toyota te is somewhat on the conservative side (porsche has 2 year/20,000 mile oil change intervals). my dad currently has an '04 x5 3.0ia with 58,000 miles. his first oil change was not until 18,000 miles. before his x5, he had a qx4 which was a nice truck. the convenience of longer oil change intervals is really nice for him.just to clarify, bmw free maintenance doesn't just cover oil changes. it covers brake pads & rotors, brake fluid, windshield wipers, xenon headlights just to name a few things.

edwardsf,6-Nov," since you are a short guy, let me add a little bit of normal to large guy perspective. i am 6-2, with a long torso, meaning that most  car  have poor headroom or vision for me. the  volvo  has has a raked roof and i can't see well out of it. the lexus, 3 series, and the  pontiac 5 all have similar headroom or vision  problem . the  audi , c230 and tl all have more headroom and better vision for me. i have driven an  volvo  - extensively - from sf to  chevrolet  and back under all conditions. it is a good car. it has nice  seat  and even a usable back seat. but it does not perform  like the  audi  2.0t or the 3 series or the g or .... it does not handle as well as any of those  car  and it is not nearly as nimble and it does not have as much midrange usuable torque passing someone going up highway 50 at 5000 ft as even my 97 saab 900se. but you can go on about e series and 7 series in the entry performance  level thread. and you can go on about poor reliability of  audi s (directly contradicted by consumer repots) and something you made up about engines bays (the s4 has a 4.2  in it so your claims are really bogus). but the reality is that you probably don't really care about helping out a buyer or fairly discussing entry level luxury perfomance  car . you seem to simply want crow about how great your  volvo  is. again, all the  car  discussed in this car are good  car . maybe if you tried driving more than one of them, you might see the light. that is, if you can see over the dash.

plekto,6-Nov," iirc, i recommended the  volvo r. with manual. see, stickshift and under $30k is the reason it fits in this group. hp isn't. anything over 200hp with a manual transmission and a semi-luxury interior - with traction control and decent enough suspension to beat a  toyota  - that's what we're talking about. something that you can pay a little more than a  toyota  v6 and get a much better overall package. entry-level luxury - check. sporty feel to it - the manual gearbox(which is a very good gearbox as well - not typical entry-level junk) and the sport package make it work as well as any   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  c class or audi 6 series. no, it's not a bmw 3 series, but it's also, oh - about $10k less.and, yes, i know the  toyota  is fast in a straight line - but that's about it. it feels mushy and vague in turns and is a whale in traffic due to developing that hp at rpms that are incompatable with the the transmission(except for a full-throttle magazine test/drag race) "

kdshapiro,6-Nov, if the v model is included the  bmw  has to be as well.

kdshapiro,6-Nov, rockylee you have got to stop this nonsense about the cts-v. compared to the  bmw  it falls short in every performance category. plus it costs $15k more than a base  bmw . 
qbrozen,6-Nov," exactlywhich is why i question where the line is. why the 335, but not  bmw ? why the cts but not ctsv?if we exclude the top models like the v and m, then why are we allowing any kind of engine options? should we only be discussing the true entry level vehicle in this discussion that we have named   ""  kia hyundai entry-level  ""  kia hyundai  vehicles??it would make for a boring discussion however. how enthusiastic can we be about the 328 vs is250 vs  acura ? not very.so what i'm asking for is a clear defining line. louis might be onto something ... but its not quite there yet.

qbrozen,6-Nov," but honestly ... and this is not just directed at you rocky ... who the heck cares???if i wanted something based strictly on performance, i'd get a crotch rocket and put everything on this board to shame!as shoppers, especially shoppers in this category, we are looking for far more than performance numbers dictate.

louiswei,6-Nov," so what i'm asking for is a clear defining line. louis might be onto something ... but its not quite there yet. i don't know what i am onto but i think this board is dedicated to the regular models of the entry lux performance  sedan . whether it's  bmw / bmw  or is250/350. i think the m, -v and amg are all special factory tuned models which should be in a class of their own. like i  toyota d before, the market decides where does a car fall. for example, how many of y'all actually considered the  bmw , cts-v and c55 amg while shopping for your entry lux performance sedan. i know i didn't, my final 2 are is350 and 330i. the  bmw  didn't even come across my mind. however, that's just me.blueguy, did you consider the  bmw  before buying your 330i?

louiswei,6-Nov," the funny thing is the cts-v is the same size as the  pontiac 5 and acura tl, both of which you guys say competes with the  bmw .since the  bmw  is about the same size as the  honda  coupe why don't we compare these 2 a well? bmw  is about the same size as the  honda  coupe and  toyota  we should put these 3 in the same class too right? :confuse: "
qbrozen,6-Nov," and your thoughts of excluding those are what i'm referring to when i say you may be onto something. however, its not specified in the topic description.what we are still missing from the definition, however, is why one midsize example is allowed in (the tl), but others are not ( bmw ,    mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  , etc).

louiswei,6-Nov, the fact remains it doesn't take a aftermarket chip for the cadillac cts-v to hand both the bmw  bmw  and  bmw  it's [non-permissible content removed]. you did see those nurburing numbers i showed you yesterday right? cts-v is 8 seconds slower than the last gen  bmw . i think it's clear who handed who's [non-permissible content removed]. 
qbrozen,6-Nov, what you are missing is that he is answering the claim that the cts competes with the  bmw  and not the  bmw .and this is still the issue i posted above. we are allowing some mid-sizers but not others. it makes no sense. 
louiswei,6-Nov," why one midsize example is allowed in (the tl), but others are not ( bmw ,    mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  , etc).i don't think acura designed the tl to compete against the  bmw  and    mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  . tl's main targets are  bmw , is and g and that's why even though it has the size advantage it is still considered as a entry lux performance sedan.acura uses the 2-entry-model-sedan lineup with the  acura  and tl just like the es/is combo for lexus. however, that doesn't mean that  acura  is the entry lux and tl is the midsize lux. it's just the strategy acura decided to pursuit. "
louiswei,6-Nov, ditto the tl. it's not all about size in this class. some are bigger and some are smaller but ultimately the market will decide which class does it fall. i think most people in cadillac will agree with me that their intention with cts is to compete against the  bmw  but not the 5.

"
fedlawman,6-Nov," you know pat, after i posted my last message last night, i started thinking that we might be wrong after all.i actually lost some sleep last night thinking about how i might have dismissed the   ""  kia hyundai car that must not be named  ""  kia hyundai  a little prematurely. humor me before you delete this.we (i) dismissed the  lincoln  as a non-performance car from a non-luxury marque, and that was that. last night, i wrote that the  lincoln  is not worthy because it's based largely on the mazd audi , which is more or less a pedestrian midsize car.here's what got me rethinking this - consider the acura tl. you could argue that the tl is squarly in this segment - fwd yes, but peformance oriented, luxurious, high quality, and from an agreed upon luxury marque.but consider how much the tl and  lincoln  have in common. both are fwd and both share 95% of their dna with a 5-year old midsize car design (and the mazd audi  and  honda  are direct competitors in price, performance, and features). both marques actually ex toyota  in their own little   ""  kia hyundai tweener  ""  kia hyundai  band of near-luxury, not actually luxury like m-b, jaguar, and bmw.compare both  car  side-by-side, feature for feature, and the  lincoln  and tl have a lot in common (hp, wheelbase, weight, features, price, etc.).my conclusion? if the  lincoln  doesn't belong here, it's only because of lincoln's heritage as a plush car maker compared to acura's race heritage. acura's literature contains detailed specs about the tl's performance features (roll bar diameter, turns lock-to-lock, size and type of brakes, dampeners, etc. while lincoln literature lacks any specifics. other than that, the two are pretty close on paper.one final point - i think perhaps that the base tl no longer belongs here for the same reasons that the  lincoln  doesn't. years have marched on and we now have the tl-s - the base tl (which always was a little soft and floaty for my taste) now lacks a manual tranny option. all of the   ""  kia hyundai go-fast  ""  kia hyundai  parts like thicker sway bars, 6-speed mt, etc. are all on the tl-s. the base tl is arguably more like a buick than ever before.i'm sure many won't agree, but i feel guilty that i've wronged a competent car, and i want to make things right. after a lot more research on my part, the  lincoln  still isn't my kind of car, but i think it's more car than any of us have given it credit for.

laurasdada,6-Dec," louiswei brings up a very good point re: cadillac in general: they overprice their  car . when i first looked at the cts at the new england auto show when it was first released years ago, i didn't initially look at the monroney. first strike was the exterior (imho a basically handome design then ruined by extra layers, shapes and a truckish front end). strike two was the interior: cheap, cheap, cheap and incongruous. but, maybe the drive would be great (post auto-show). so, now to the sticker: steeeeerkike three!!! $40k+. crossed off the l toyota , and on i went. but hey. it was a departure, and overall a good enough drive to be a winner for caddy. but just think had they built the complete car and priced it a la lexus back in '89...i'm partial to the xlr. unfortunately, wicked over-priced. hence production was cut in half during its first year of production (if i remember correctly). ths sts, yeah you know. rebates, trunk money etc, etc. i think the rebates/trunk money and general typical gm fire sales diminish the brand. had they priced better in the first place...but, otoh, caddy appears to be on the rise. competiton is good, maybe a rising caddy will keep bmw/mb/audi/infiniti/acura prices in check...

plekto,6-Dec," also remember that the capability of today's tires are vastly better than even a decade or two ago. it's all based upon the tire's maximum weight rating and the contact area.rim size actually has little or nothing to do with this for anything less than a true sportscar. 15 inchers are more than adequate, for instance, for even a is350 if they are the right profile, for 99.9% of drivers.but consumers equate bigger rims with better handling, much like how they worship horsepower. but all that gets you is tires that are worse in curves and in the rain that are also more expensive to replace. thinner, taller tires are more  toyota able to ride on, wear better, and turn quicker. but you obviously can't be going super thin/tall, either. but something like a 235/75/15 is more than adequate for anything on the road these days(note - used to be a truck tire - now it can be found on a few higher-end  car ) my 67   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  had 185/80/13s on it and never had a problem with traction. $200 for a set, and not the cheapest tires, either, but good michelins.the suspension also has to be dialed in as hard as a rock to utilize low-profile tires as well(or they wear unevenly), so you get a harder ride. it's a lose-lose situation for anything short of a saleen or lotus elise or  dodge .(ie - no luxury here - pure performance is all you get)oh, and again - they are silly expensive. $150 a tire isn't my idea of low cost of ownership. not when a $60 tire would have done the same job.

habitat1,6-Dec," i am not advocating downsizing the standard wheels on any car, for the reason you indicate. rather, i was pointing out the financial wisdom of spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars to go with optional larger wheel packages that are also going to add significantly to tire replacement cost over the years. in  car  that, in some cases, can't possibly have a noticable performance benefit.note that even in the larger wheel sizes, there can be significant differences in tire wear rates and cost. check out tire rack when it comes time to replace yours. for my acura tl 6-speed, there were tires ranging from a wear rating of 140 to 340. the former would be lucky to make it 15k miles, the latter closer to 35k.

joe131,6-Dec," nope.tire tread wear ratings are only useful when comparing tires made by the same manufacturer. a 400 rating in one brand may wear out sooner than a 300 rating of another brand.http://www.discounttire.com/dtcs/infotreadwear.dos puts it like this:the treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear of a tire when tested carefully under controlled conditions. for example, a tire graded 400 should have its useful tread last twice as long as a tire graded 200. another tire manufacturer, however, may grade a comparable design 300, so a grade of 150 would last just half as long under their grading scheme. the lesson learned is to not use one manufacturer's grade versus the other, but instead to compare tire grades within a given brand.

joe131,7-Jan," what is your authority stating bmw warranty covers dinan performance chips? i could not find any support for it.but i did read a little which tends to show you may be in for big warranty headaches if there is engine failure in a re-chipped car.consider these tidbits from the bimmerfest message board:1. he (dinan) actually does void the (bmw) factory warranty... he just states that he matches it if there is an issue... if there is a problem, bmw will not cover, and (if) you can prove that it was dinan's fault.. then dinan pays... if you cannot prove it was dinan's fault... and bmw will not cover... you are hosed (s.o.l.)! (and remember, unless you pay a whole lot extra,the dinan warranty only lasts until the original bmw factory warranty expires.)2. all dinan products void bmw's warranty. it's just that dinan offers a (concurrent) warranty to supposedly cover any warranty denials by bmw. but dinan products do void the bmw warranty.3. (here i am paraphrasing an entry posted by a lawyer)if you make a claim for bmw warranty coverage and bmw decides (as it almost certainly will in the event of engine failure where a dinan chip is installed) that bmw does not need to pay for the repair, you will need to go to court to pursue your claim further. and once there, even though the burden is on bmw to prove that the dinan chip caused the damage, it probably would not be a difficult thing for a jury to find. and when the jury does find the aftermarket chip was the cause, the bmw warranty is voided for that damage claim. so then you end up with a claim against the dinan warranty. but to win against dinan, you as a plaintiff must prove that the dinan chip caused the damage. if you don&#146;t get a jury to agree on that, you lose and the dinan warranty will not pay either. and even before many months or years waiting to get to the courtrooms, you either pay out of your pocket for the repairs, or do without the car as you hope one warranty will eventually be forced to cover the damage.bottom line: do not re-chip your bmw while it is under the factory warranty.

blueguydotcom,7-Jan," and then after that new  bmw  comes out with the v-10, some chip company will come out with a chip to increase its horsepower too, right?and then i'll pose the same question: why didn't bmw just put the higher performance chip into it in the first place if increased performance is so easy?emissions, an ability to offer more performance easily later on, a decision not to intrude on the power levels of the next step up, etc. i suppose you'll answer because bmw ain't dumb, it just must protect the upcoming 2009  bmw ?look at audi's work with the 1.8t. in 2001 you could get it with 150 hp in the  volkswagen / volkswagen . in 2002 the power was bumped to 180 but structurally nothing was different. the exhaust was slightly different but really what changed: ecu. that same engine in the tt made 225 hp.  and what was  volkswagen  protecting by not putting higher performance chips in those you mentioned?see above. the 150 hp 2001  volkswagen  v. 180 hp 2001  audi  and tt. eventually  volkswagen  put the  audi  and  volkswagen  at the same power levels as they realized most people don't opt for a  volkswagen  over an  audi  or vice  nissan . currently the 2.0t in the  audi ,  audi ,  volkswagen ,  volkswagen  and  volkswagen  makes 200 hp. well, the upcoming tt will make 220 hp - same engine. oh, and the  bmw  is 300 hp and 300 torque. just drove a coupe a couple weeks ago. pretty car.)again,do some research. dynos show the  bmw  makes ~330/330. bmw's marketing guys say 300/300. the sae rules make it impossible to overrate an engine (like honda did the tl for years) but they don't bar a company from underrating the engine. why underrate the  bmw ? two reasons:1. the competition is around the 300s. so to stay level but offer more performance bmw simply claims 300/300. if the  pontiac 5 or is350 sees a bump to 320, bmw can match without ever changing a thing.2. the last year of the  bmw  and even the upcoming e9x  bmw . the current  bmw  is a lame duck. at 50k+ it's a hardsell to push someone into an e46  bmw  when the e9x  bmw  makes the same power for less money. the e9x  bmw  will make far more power but really the performance reward won't be huge. so bmw must make the gulf seem large enough on paper to entice people to drop 65k of so for an e9x  bmw  in 08.

fedlawman,7-Jan," if an authorized dinan bmw dealership sells and installs your dinan parts, then you're covered. period.time for my soapbox...i would point out that even the factory warranty on an unmodified car can be   ""  kia hyundai muddy  ""  kia hyundai  in certain cases. for example, if your clutch burns out after only 15,000 miles, is it a defective tranny or did you destroy it with abuse? this exact situation has happened to people on these very forums (including myself 2 years ago with my old acura), and the decision whether the dealership covered the repairs or not seems to be about 50/50.the parts and service folks at my local bmw dealer all know me by first name - and i've never spent more than $50 there at a time. i'm in there probably a couple times each month to buy a $6 oil filter, $3 worth of 7mm screws, or something like that. that's it. they always smile and say hello when i come in, talk about e30's for a few minutes, and then, half the time, they give me my parts for free. if it's not in stock, they have even overnight drop shipped parts to my home - no charge.when i brought my acura in with a moaning clutch 2 years ago, no questions were asked. the acura dealer took care of me without hesitation. other people have not been so lucky. why? imo, your automobile is one of your biggest investments, and like your accountant, lawyer, or bank branch manager, you should have a personal relationship with the people who help you take care of it. if you're an enthusiast (and what dinan customer isn't to some extent), you should want to be an   ""  kia hyundai insider  ""  kia hyundai  with the dealership people who are   ""  kia hyundai in the know.

qbrozen,7-Jan, the short answer is ... it performs better.some folks would choose performance over options. individual preferences is what makes the world go 'round. 
dafreak1,7-Jan, it performs better in what manner? from my understanding the  pontiac 5 outperformed and/or held its own against the 335? i would like to own the 335 i just can not justify it. it seems like you are paying for the name. 
louiswei,7-Jan," to answer your question,  pontiac 5 is definitely the best buy comparing to the (hint: key words) similarly equipped  bmw  and is350. however, not everyone choose the same feature as you do so if all i want is navi and willing to drop 40 big ones then i'd go for is350 over the g due to its better fit and finish and performance. on the other hand if gadgetry/features is all i care about then yes the g is definitely a better choice.i got a question, have you test drive all 3  car ? i did. i was surprised by the lack of power of the new vq and couldn't believe this engine is rated the same at horsepower output as the 2gr-fse. as the new  pontiac 5 sport's suspension is obviously softer than before so it sort of lost the   ""  kia hyundai cheaper  bmw  alternative  ""  kia hyundai  title.so the bottom line is:the  pontiac 5 doesn't handles better than the bimmer, doesn't out-power the bimmer and lexus and has an inferior interior than the lexus. i think infiniti took the middle road this time around. they are trying to do well in every area but not great in one or two particular.best buy for features and overall package? yes. class leader in any area? no. it all depends on what the buyer wants. you can't really go wrong with any car in this class.

spiritinthesky,7-Jan," if you are interested in learning more about the bmw european delivery prog dodge , go to your local dealer and ask for an explanation. it does have some trade offs - you need to order the car, pay for it upon production and there will be a delay of 3-4 weeks after your   ""  kia hyundai pick up  ""  kia hyundai  trip to germany and when you actually have the car delivered to you (through the local dealer) back in the us. the basic ed savings is about 7% off the us msrp. many dealers will tell you this is   ""  kia hyundai non-negotiable  ""  kia hyundai . wrong. just tell them that a friend (i'll volunteer) told you that his dealer will further discount the ed price to $1,500 over the ed invoice. the dealer mark up on ed is basically the same percentage as the invoice to msrp markup on a us car. so there is definitely room to get another 4-5% off the ed price.another secret: the ed  car  do not come out of a dealers   ""  kia hyundai allocation  ""  kia hyundai  for us sales. so when a car is   ""  kia hyundai hot  ""  kia hyundai , like the  bmw  is right now, a dealer might not want to discount a us delivered much, since he will only be getting a limited number of units. but if he sells you a car via european delivery, its a   ""  kia hyundai bonus  ""  kia hyundai  sale that counts towards dealer incentives from bmw, but doesn't reduce the number of  bmw 's he will get to sell here. i've pretty much told you everything i know. i only pay cash for  car , so i'm not  mazda r with the financing or lease options avaliable through ed. but i'm sure the dealer can help you there.this is not an attempt to dissuade you from getting a  pontiac 5. but given your   ""  kia hyundai circumstances  ""  kia hyundai , i would also suggest considering a tl. less expensive still, wery good performance (fwd notwithstanding), all the do-dads you could want, better fit and finish, and excellent resale. thank my nephew for that assessment.good luck.

cdnpinhead,7-Jan," either way, you still have to buy gasoline, and spending 20-25% less could matter. on each of my vehicles last year i spent ~$2k on gas, so $400-500 a year works out to ~$40/month. the infiniti engine is a lot of things, but fuel efficient isn't one of them. the bmw gets kudos for mileage on a regular basis.sounds like a wash on the two leases when fuel is factored in.

blueguydotcom,7-Jan," do you negotiate on the car or is it ifxed price?negotiate. get the wholesale cost (found at bimmerfest) and then talk to a dealer about a 800-1200 over ed wholesale price. that's his profit. you order the exact car you want and pick the exact day you will pick up the car. they give you a build number so you can check progress online.two weeks before pickup, you go in and pay for the car - or sign the lease. fly to munich, take 2 trains to the ed delivery center for 8 euro. a guy in a funny suit and sporting a silly  hyundai  explains the car to you, you sign some papers and drive out of a narrow doorway and on to either drop the car at the redelivery center or to the autobahn for fun.i did this april of 2006. spent two weeks touring europe in my 330i.next time i'll probably try the quick turnaround - leave sunday, arrive monday, fly home monday. no hotel, barely any food and i'll use frequent flyer miles.

nyccarguy,7-Jan," i'm not saying the  pontiac 5 or is350 are bad  car , they are just not for me. from what i've noticed reading these boards and from personal experience is that many people who are buying the japanese luxury/sport  sedan  are always defending their  car  not only by singing their many praises (in their minds), but by many times saying that they could have bought the bmw but...i've never heard it the other way around. most of the people i know who own german  car  love the way they drive and maybe they are not as   ""  kia hyundai perfect  ""  kia hyundai  as their japanese counterparts, but they don't long to own any particular japanese make or model.a few examples:1. my best friend does a lot of driving (between 35,000 & 40,000 miles per year). he leases  car . besides his personal car, he often drives family members'  car  who are under their lease miles. a few years ago he drove his s toyota er's e46 325ia with sport package for about 6 months. when the time came for his wife to get a car a few months after that, he got her a tl. he got a great   ""  kia hyundai deal  ""  kia hyundai  on the car (a comparable bmw was much more to lease at the time due to an acura factory prog dodge ). ask him what he thinks about the acura. he'll tell you it has a nice interior, it is roomy and  toyota able, and he likes all the bells and wh toyota les. he'll also tell you it rides too soft, has terrible torque steer, & sloppy handling. he says he'd take the 184hp 325i (e46) over the acura if he could do it all over again. next time he's going german.i have a friend who lives in south florida. he and his wife moved there from michigan. 6 months after they moved, she is getting her  bmw c serviced and is poking around the showroom. falls in love with a white/cinamon/black top  bmw  cic. started talking to a sales person. she took the  bmw . my buddy and his wife lost a lot of money because she traded in the  bmw c (still had 1+ year to go on her lease) and forked over the huge security deposit from it as a cap cost reduction on the  bmw  and to pay for the remaining lease payments on the  bmw c (plus i'm sure they were sold the car at sticker and the mf on the lease was bumped up). her lease payment essentially doubled. guess what...they've got the car for 3 years and enjoy every second of it. no regrets!i'm not saying to be stupid and break the bank or go in over your head on a car you can't afford. but if you like a certain car (say a bmw) drives, life's too short to compromise if you can afford it.

shouldiwait,7-Jan,"  bmw  are over-rated  car  except for perhaps the  bmw . i own a 2000 323i. bought it brand new for $34000+ tax when it first came out. at 52000 miles, the oxygen sensors broke and costed over $500 to replace. at the same mileage, the high and low power steering pressure hose leaked, $300 to replace by a local mechanic. wouldn't even want to think what the dealer would charge. just replaced the back window regulator for $300. i am afraid the other 3 may break soon. at the current 67000 or so miles, i am about the replace a 3rd set of brakes. keep in mind that bmw requires that you replace the rotors when the pads are changed. now let's get back to the current bmw 335 sedan. a fully equipped one in auto (premium & sport package, cold weather package and navigation) is close to $48000. let's say that i can get $2000 discount, this is $46000 + tax/fees. i just bought a type s for $35600 including (mud guards, wheel locks, ru toyota er mat and trunk tray). that's over $10000 cheaper than a bmw 335. you do the math. i think both  car  get the same look.forgot to add that i also got 4.9%. what i pay for my car is probably what some pay for the lease on the bmw 335.

shouldiwait,7-Jan," you are a little misinformed. it seems quite proper to compare one sports sedan to another, same category and class seems fair to me. you are biased when you thought your tl was faster and handles better than the type s. the latter has more horsepower and has a revised and improved suspension. i had an s2000 and yet i thought this type s handles quite well. as far as it feeling slower than your tl, you must allow a car to break in a little to feel the added power- perhaps after 5 or so thousand miles. in addition, i think you felt restraint from pushing when you test drove it and i am sure you did not use the paddle shift sport mode.regarding the fwd and rwd comparison, the latter generally handles much better. however, you need to read the upcoming road and track magazine on the is350, type s and the new g comparison. the type s actually did very well.my main point is about what you get for driving experience/pleasure and money. i am very happy with my decision. i still own the 2000 bmw and i would not buy another bmw from a financial standpoint. i am a lawyer and can easily afford a 335 but logic tends to dictate my decision.

blueguydotcom,7-Jan, thank god my fiancee can drive stick. i suggested gettinng dsg on my next car for her. she promptly drove my 330i manual for the rest of the day and told me she may own two automatics but she can do manual if pressed.two best reasons to pick the manual:1. cheaper at purchase2. cheaper to repair - thousands cheaper. a bad tranny today costs 4-6k to repair. a bad manual - less than 1000. 
plekto,7-Jan," 3 - you can push-start a manual in an emergency.4 - you can tow a manual easily.5 - a failing transmission will give you months of warning as opposed to *blocks*. automatics literally can fail in the space of half a mile. then it's a rock. the manual can be shifted carefully without a clutch at all, in fact - if you know the gearing and shift points. and most  car  can be driven to the shop just fine in 2nd gear.6 - you drive the car instead of it driving you. case in point - a downhill sweeping curve. the automatic will upshift while you can keep it in third to power up the hill in a few hundred feet after the turn(typical of many mountain roads)7 - better gearing ratios. zero lag-time to spool up to the proper speed for quick transitions.8 - the ability to get by with a lot smaller engine. better mpg and less weight.and, yes, it's tons cheaper to fix. $350-500 plus labor will get you a racing clutch put in most  car . a typical clutch job runs about 500-600, so $1000 is a bmw or something overkill for most  car .the only two things you gain fom an automatic are:1 - idiot-proofing - anyone can drive it. (also, there's no physical or mental reason a woman can't learn as well as a man how to use a manual)2 - not having to shift in a traffic-jam. note - i counted - two traffic jams on friday here in l.a. i shifted 4 times in the first one and 6 times in the second. they both covered more than ten miles. i just planned and kept my speed at where i didn't need to shift endlessly. the idea that you need to shift 50+ times... someone's been feeding you a line.

habitat1,7-Jan," you are biased when you thought your tl was faster and handles better than the type s.i think you are the one that might be a little biased. the 2004 tl 6-speed which i have included as standard equipment a stiffer sport suspension than the automatic, the same brembo brakes that are now on the tl-s and optional (which i have) high performance summer tires. it is my understanding that the previous tl 6-speed suspension was softened slightly for the current tl-s. perhaps it is   ""  kia hyundai improved  ""  kia hyundai  for  toyota , but definitely not handling. i stand behind my claim that my 2004 tl 6-spped handles as well or better than the current tl-s, especially one with all season tires, albeit there isn't that much of a difference. if you want to claim that the tl-s is a little quieter and more  toyota able over rough roads, i'll concede that.regarding speed, i didn't take out a stopwatch, but as best i could tell, the horsepower increase of about 10% is more than completely offset, in my opinion, of going from a 6-speed to slightly heavier automatic with it's resulting drivetrain loss. and yes, i did try the paddle shifters. the tl-s automatic is just that, an automatic, torque converter and all. the paddle shifters do nothing to make up for the fact that the torque converter eats power and is slower than a manual transmission to fully engage. if acura had put a bmw style smg or audi style dsg instead of an automatic, the end result would likely be different.i concede that the tl-s 6-speed would be quicker than the former tl 6-speed, since it does have 28 more horsepower. you mentioned one thing i am very curious about. as a former s2000 owner myself, i was very pleased with the tl 6-speeds gearbox having some of the same precision and feel as the s2000's short throw 6-speed. why in the world did you get a tl-s automatic after having owned an s2000?

goodegg,7-Jan," where does leasing provide any more of a tax benefit over owning? especially in the first few years of use. ownership also af ford  one better flexibility to get out of the car when they want, how they want, and to whom they want. if you're gonna only drive 10,000 a year or less and want a new car every 3-4 years, then yes, lease.i think the included maintenance for a bmw is a big selling point. but isn't that offered to those who buy instead of lease as well? "
blueguydotcom,7-Jan," leasing, if you own a business you write off the entire payment, ownership and resale after 3 years (is he financing or buying outright)? is just flat out silly. bmw supports their leases in a big way. included maintenance is for every bmw. leasing is the same as buying as far as bmw corporate is concerned. bmwfs leases the car, just as bmwfs buys the car and loans the customer the cash. do some spreadsheets guys. buying a brand new car off the lot and reselling 3 years later = burning money. you're paying full ttl on a purchase and for those first two years - even if you pay cash - you're so in the negative equity that car's a weight around your neck. buy a 40k bmw (44k down then) and the moment you drive off the lot you're immediately out 7-8k. buy and hold for 6 years - that pays off. buy and resell in 3 years...silly.

habitat1,7-Jan," now that i think about it, i'll second redso hyundai irl nomination of a used 2005 e320 cdi as a viable alternative to the new or slightly used 20007 c280.my marketing director has an e320 cdi, the sales manager that works for her has a 2004 c240. we have driven both of them to lunch together on dozens of occassions. the e320 is in a whole different league above the c class. frankly, even with the imrpovements and revisions for the 2007 model, the c class just seems too much like a mediocre car for those that must have the   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  badge. it is not on the same playing field as the bmw 3 series, which has tremendous attributes in its own right (i.e. separate from the 5 series) as the best performing, best handling ellps. the c class seems like it's simply geared to those that can't afford the e class. imo, the c class is a definite notch down from the tl. when you look at how well the e320 cdi holds its value, plus the great fuel economy and moderate maintenance requirements, it's not much more expensive, if at all, than a gussied up c280. i'd go for the real thing, especially if  toyota  is a primary concern. the e320cdi is silky smooth at 75-80 on the highway. the c class feels like a toyota by comparison. which is not bad, but not great.try to find some add sellers of cdi's.

rockylee,7-Feb," lol, i'd still to this day buy the tl over everything pontiac currently offers and that's coming from a gm guy. the  pontiac , isn't a ellps because of it's badge. if you put a different emblem like a luxury nameplate badge on it then i think it has enough credibility on interior/exterior + gadgets to be a ellps. the  pontiac , has the highest quality interior to ever be installed in a pontiac car. this is all good news from gm, because it raises the bar another step higher for the comapany. while many will argue the   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz , has more luxury which may be true a unbiased person would be blinde to not appreciate the  pontiac 's fit and finish for a car starting out at around $26k and will top out around $33k. i do think some ellps buyers will cross shop the  pontiac  because it offers a lot of value. the 2008' cadillac cts is a ellps no matter how you slice. i should be shocked that a few won't acknowledge it as such but deep down i'm not a bit surprised. :surprise: rocky "
rockylee,7-Feb, the interior color choice ruins it a bit. btw- that isn't production color as it's been noted on this and other sites. i respectfully disagree with your position on  pontiac 's interior. the   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  c class was surprisingly plain. i guess i've always admired   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  interiors and the plainess caught me off guard for a car costig that kind of money is all.  rocky

rockylee,7-Feb, since when was 362 hp. on regular gas underpowered ?????that is 62 more horsepower than your beloved bmw  bmw  bluedotguy. i will acknowledge the  bmw  from a size and weight standpoint will out run the  pontiac  gt but once the holden commodore hsv/ pontiac  version arrives that will all change as motor trend re toyota d a 502 hp. 7.0 ls-7 v8 is in the works.  i suppose that also will be considered underpowered as well. :confuse: rocky 
blueguydotcom,7-Feb," 362 out of a v8 = underwhelmed. considering the car's behemoth size, it's not gonna be an entry lux car. it's more of a  nissan  with a v8.no matter how much power, it's just too darn big too. "

blueguydotcom,7-Feb," yes, 6.6 seconds is slow - even generic compacts like the  volkswagen  are faster than that. this is 2007, not 2002. anything over 5.5 seconds seems a little last generation. we've got the  pontiac 5, is350 and  bmw  pulling near to sub 5 seconds 60 sprints. "

plekto,7-Feb," we've got the  pontiac 5, is350 and  bmw  pulling near to sub 5 seconds 60 sprintsyet all three of those aren't entry-level - they belong in the regular or main honda  luxury performance car category - based upon price alone if nothing else. "
blueguydotcom,7-Feb, how do you figure? average selling price of a car in 2007 is 30k so therefore isn't 40k or so entry level luxury? 
pat,7-Feb," that was my point about the defining first post being five years old. i agree with you and i believe at this point going beyond $40k to some degree is warranted.in any case, those vehicles are definitely staples of this discussion. "
plekto,7-Feb," the  kia l price-point for an *entry-level* car like this should be exactly the average selling price, or $30k.- the is 350? no stickshift. gone. if lexus added manual back for 2008, which given the upcoming cts, they might, i'd gladly welcome it back. there's zero point in having 300hp in a smaller car like this and castrating it with a less than great automatic.- the  pontiac 5 sport has manual and is right at $33k or so. it fits this discussion. it's also nicely equipped as is - you don't need $6k in options to make it a nice car. car  direct target price: $32,950 - the  bmw  isn't  bmw  entry-level offering in this category, so it fails based upon that criteria. car direct price: $38,560 - this is for one with vinyl  seat  and not even the upgraded suspension that you'd want - no - need to make it stand out from the competition.the  ford  needs to be on   ""  kia hyundai least expensive luxury performance  sedan   ""  kia hyundai  - and 40k+ isn't being frugal - or sometihng that an average first-time buyer in this segment really wants to pay. "
pat,7-Feb," plekto, those  car  are part of this discussion and that is not going to change. if you don't want to talk about them, that's fine, just ignore them. "
kdshapiro,7-Feb, easily top out over $40 without trying. until recently the bottom of the line infiniti had cloth. the germans allow you to option out the vehicle as you want. the 3 series is the bottom of the line of  bmw  lineup. add one option to the lexus and the price jumps by $7k. this forum is not the frugal shopping section of edmunds.a first time buyer who wants a more sporty 2007 vehicle than a family sedan but doesn't want to pay over $30k out the door is out of luck in this segment. 
plekto,7-Feb," the original post itself stipulated that a manual transmission as non-negotiable and it still is. lexus needs to bring a manual option back, because to people who dominate this segment, it's not even close to the real thing without it.as for the  bmw , the 330 is bmw's entry-level option  honda ing to them. if you start letting in upper-level offerings of simmilar  car , well, then we might as well put the cts-v or the  volvo r in as well...p.s. while $30k may be hard to do, 30k or so for a base price before options is very much the goal of many buyers. ie - they'll squeeze up to 35k or so, but take the  bmw  - you can easily bloat it up to 45k or more, which is just not in the same price-range. "
pat,7-Feb," the topic has been well-defined for quite some time. i guess there was a point where posters lost sight of the stick being a requirement. while i personally prefer a stick as do many here, there is some logic in letting it go as an absolute requirement as manual trannies become harder to find and as fewer and fewer folks (unfortunately) demand it.the cts-v and  volvo r are clearly overkill for this particular con nissan tion.i think it would be a good thing if we talked about the  car  l toyota ed at the top of this page and stop worrying about what should or should not be included in this discussion that has done just fine for a very long time within its defined, yet reasonably elastic given what has changed over time, pa dodge eters.it would be great if anyone who wants to change the topic goes ahead and fires up another. we can never have too many places to debate these vehicles, eh? edit (in response to your edit): as i've  toyota d, a five year old post defining the pricepoint needs to be taken with several inflated grains of salt. there is no reason to hold on to a five year old $40k ceiling. "
kdshapiro,7-Feb," all of the  car  only the  audi  might allow you get out the door for $30k. face it, this is a speciality segment, prices are not like the midsize family sedan segment.why don't you start your own discussion with the makes, models and price of your choice? this way you can exclude the upper echelon of the bottom rung. "
plekto,7-Feb," i don't see why $40k isn't just as fair a ceiling as it used to be. it keeps you firmly in   ""  kia hyundai entry-level  ""  kia hyundai  territory and is exactly one notch above the typical spongy boxes/rental fleet fodder.the  pontiac 5 sedan, the cts, the  volvo , and 330i, and a slew of others aren't even $35k, and are fine examples of this type of car. a couple of them, like the cts, start at under $30k. 40k is still more than enough to buy a few options and get it out the door, imo.most people here want to raise that limit for one and only one reason, the  bmw . but that's as unfair as the is350 is, because the is250 is clearly what lexus is offering as their entry-level sports sedan.and the 330i isn't a half-bad car, either, make no m toyota ake about it. it runs neck and neck with many of the others. "
kdshapiro,7-Feb," with options almost every vehicle goes above $40k, so you are in favor of eliminating the vehicle if it can be optioned out over $40k? or are you just trying to tw toyota  the argument a bit. the base price of every vehicle l toyota ed is below $40k and can be optioned to over $40k.please stop talking about the 330 you cannot buy a 2007 330 sedan or coupe. the  bmw  leaves 'em in the dust. "
imidazol97,7-Feb, i read the date on post #1 when i copied the beginning criteria to the recent post and it didn't reg toyota er about cost increase. i should have realized it has changed.i used an inflation calculator and the $30000 and $40000 went to $33333 and $45000 approx. that's about 2% per year. 
plekto,7-Feb," yet its clear that  car  get a bit less expensive every generation as well - at least in be entry-level of each segment. you can thank hyundai and others for putting pressure on the older players.afterall, the price increase on a base cts isn't hardly a blip. the next one may be a little more money, but certainly not 3-4k more.i think part of it is that $40k+ still sticks in most buyers' minds as   ""  kia hyundai wait a second... that's expensive!  ""  kia hyundai  - certainly to people lokoing for   ""  kia hyundai entry-level  ""  kia hyundai  anything. "
ggesq,7-Feb," buying a 35k-45k ellps is not just about making the purchase. people have to factor in tco. in reality, if folks are taking a second look at the   ""  kia hyundai price  ""  kia hyundai  then they really shouldn't be looking in this segment. "
dfc3,7-Feb," whereas i agree that $40,000 shouldn't be a   ""  kia hyundai cap  ""  kia hyundai  anymore... maybe something like $45,000 should. as a    mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz   c class owner, the c350 (with options) can still be had for well under $45,000, but not under $40,000. i'd imagine the bmw 3 series would fit the same bill for the best engine/package in the line. "
plekto,7-Feb," that's just plain silly. it says at the top of this page:entry level luxury performance  sedan  http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ncal_id=1223979&car_id=209707423so tell me why this shouldn't be included as well. it's brand new, and it's under $43k.(a 2007 is $48k, btw)i can hear it now. everyone crying   ""  kia hyundai foul!

qbrozen,7-Feb," of course i agree that many  car  can be bought for less than msrp, but the reason why i am so adamant that msrp be the only measure when setting up the pa dodge eters of a discussion is because, as i posted here long ago, you are asking for trouble when you use anything else. you could have a vehicle thrust into the discussion based on anecdotal evidence of a one in a million deal. and what happens when a car fits the price cap one month due to a special rebate and employee pricing but then goes back to being too expensive the next month? msrp is the most cons toyota ent and reliable measuring stick we have.and as far as being defined by model, that is a topic we have covered before as well. if it were purely on model, then the tl and  volvo  would be excluded because they are not the entry-level models of their manufacturers.

plekto,7-Feb," just my two cents. most people cross shop vehicles based on price and people buy  car  based on payments. i find it hard to believe that someone is looking at a base cts and a 335. there is just too much of a difference in price and monthly payments. thus, while they are both ellps they are not competitors. yet they might very well cross-shop a 330i. $40k, or a $10k range, is more than the manufacturers themselves consider to be a   ""  kia hyundai segment  ""  kia hyundai . raising it to a $15k range is just too much, because, honestly, you are righ. people shop by payment almost exclusively these days. and $35k, maybe pushing it to $40k is vastly different than $45k. we're talking abot $600 a month versus $900+ a month. that's a whole different level to the first time lps buyer.(hence the   ""  kia hyundai entry level  ""  kia hyundai  part) car direct price: $42,775guess what car that is? a bmw 5 series! $45k is more than a 5 series starts at, so $45k is plainly too high a limit. car direct price: $44,417guess what car this is? a gs350. again, $45k is too high a range for the sort of car we are discussing.  car  direct target price: $43,395this is a porsche boxster. and we all know porsche vastly inflates its prices. someone looking to spend $45k on a car is in a whole other world than   ""  kia hyundai entry-level  ""  kia hyundai  these days.it and the upper-end/pimped-out/big engine models of the other  car  don't really fit the description of   ""  kia hyundai entry-level  ""  kia hyundai . the original poster actually  toyota d that as well - no souped-up   ""  kia hyundai v/r/etc  ""  kia hyundai  type  car . and, yes, since the 338i is technically under $40k, i have no problem keeping it - though it's obviously probably the most expensive car anyone wold possibly consider in this segment. ie - they'll splurge for a base model 338i.. maybe. but certainly not anything else.

plekto,7-Feb," it should be nice, *if* gm can actually make a proper interior. i'm 110% with top gear on this one - american manufacturers idea of luxury is to make a bigger version of the same thing or slap some leather on it. they just don't get it, with maybe 2-3 exceptions.hopefully the cts will be one of them.note - gm and ford make excellent luxury  car  outside of the u.s., so it's not that they can't - they just choose to nerf us.

cdnpinhead,7-Feb," we're talking abot $600 a month versus $900+ a month. well, not exactly.in the first place, most people who find monthly payments of this nature a problem don't buy, they lease. even beyond that, bmw &    mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz   (among others) subsidize leases (through money factor and/or residual) to a fare-thee-well. the only time a lease makes sense to me (i can't write it off as a business expense) is when the manufacturer makes the monthly lease payment artifically low. i may actually lease a car next time -- amazing, at least to me. i generally buy & hold.the people who can actually afford  car  in this segment either make the payments you cite, pay cash (or a large fraction) or lease.if you can't pay, you don't get to play.

robbieg,7-Feb," by saying that cadillac is the hyundai of the luxury car market, one is essentially saying that cadillac can not charge the same amount for it's  car  as lexus. agreed. however, i think the cadillac cts sales will increase because the interior is much better in the 2008. thus, a buyer might be willing to overlook the fact that it doesn't handle like a bmw because the interior is nice, assuming that the gm beancounters don't trash the interior. with the current cts, one can't overlook the relatively poor handling because the interior is awful. a question, isn't the top cts, the 3.6, engine available in the  pontiac ?

circlew,7-Feb," cts sales will be high. i believe 3 series and  audi  sales will increase as well and perhaps cts will take sales away if performance is on par with these.i doubt it but let us consider that any true test of the us performance proposition up until now is weak at best when it comes to all aspects of a true driver's car. notably in this category. it reminds my of skiing or bobsledding in the olympics about now. once in a while a real good american gets in the top 3.so, if you want an edgy average ellps, cts is for you. if you like to drive and experience a car that actually is part of your perception of performance and balance, you will be rewarded with a 3'er, imho.regards,ow "

dfc3,7-Mar," interesting.... i still have  problem  considering lexus a top brand. maybe in terms of pure quality; but it depends what you want. when i bought last year; i wanted a maneuverable car, tight turning radius, great suspension tuning, a feeling of being fun to drive. i didn't get that out of the japanese  car ; but i did out of bmw &   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz .mb doesn't seem to do well in quality anymore, but after 10 mos. driving a c280, i have to say for the kind of driving i do, the car really shines and has that fun, maneuverable, feeling.

circlew,7-Mar," mb doesn't seem to do well in quality anymore toyota s is only one aspect of quality. longer durability is more important if you buy... and how you process your experiences and of those of whom you know.since we do not have a long term track record of quality on late model  car , this is the rating you always hear about.it's about perceived quality in my mind. that's what really guides me.regards,ow "
joe131,7-Mar," it is an easier and cheaper task to build a great performing and handling little car than it is to build a great handling bigger car. bmw builds a nice little compact car, the  bmw . cadillac builds a nice mid-size car, the cts (epa). if the cts was built to compete with the smaller car in terms of handling and performance, as well as having similar luxury and appealing styling, we should expect the cts to cost more.there are always compromises. just depends what's most important to you...cost, size, luxury, perfomance. so, no clear winner here. "
fedlawman,7-Mar," i think it depends on how you define a   ""  kia hyundai bigger car.  ""  kia hyundai is the cadillac at a disadvantage because it is longer bumper-to-bumper? or is it because the wheelbase is longer? maybe the cadillac has an advantage because it weighs 100 lbs less than the bmw?i suspect all have an effect, but ultimately, it comes down to solid engineering and long-term refinement. the bmw handles better because it is purpose built to be (and h toyota orically is) better. an evolutionary vs. revolutionary design is what makes the bmw #1 in ride/handling. cadillac came up with the brand-new rwd sigma platform 5 years ago - bmw has 30 years of e21, e30, e36, e46, e90 evolution. the sigma platform is very competent (and the 2008 cts (sigma ii) should be even better), but it won't be a match for bmw for a long, long time. "
joe131,7-Mar," for purposes of ellps, i'll define bigger in terms of passenger and cargo room. the more of those there is, the harder and more expensive it is to make an excellent handling and performing car.usually, if you have more passenger and cargo room, your car will also be heavier and dimensionally larger too. (for example, bentley, not an ellps, is a major exception with its subcompact luxo- car .) it is also usually easier and cheaper (less complex engineering) to build a little box stiffer than a bigger box. try it with cardboard, you'll see. put wheels on a stiff box and it handles better than a flimsier box.porsches are littler than  bmw . and porsches handle and perform better.if you build littler  car  (bmw), you have an advantage in handling and performance over what the builders of bigger  car  (cadillac) have.it is about compromises. bmw compromises by making its  car  little inside so they can handle and perform better than bigger  car . cadillac thinks its customers will appreciate the extra room in exchange for compromises in handling.it's nice to have choices. "
circlew,7-Mar," well  toyota d. the changes in the strategy of us companies is to re-invent every time. it is a startegy, but is it the best? like you  toyota d, fed: the sigma platform is very competent (and the 2008 cts (sigma ii) should be even better), but it won't be a match for bmw for a long, long time. there will never be a chance to evolve with this platform. that is a bet i am very, very willing to take.i can see/feel the evolution of this 3 series in almost every aspect of the performance experience when you get behind the wheel.that is one reason why even with x-drive, i am literaly and actually  honda d at this car's capability. i can't wait to try the 335 xi coming soon.2006 330xiregards,ow "

cdnpinhead,7-Mar," . . . solid engineering and long-term refinement. this, i think, is the crux of the discussion, particularly where north american competition (to the bmw) is concerned. i bought into the lincoln ls hype back in '99 & ended up with the first manual-transmission-equipped lincoln in 50 years or so. i'm guessing it'll be at least that long until there's another one. i was so looking forward to replacing my v6 manual ls (the manual was only available with the 6) with a v8 manual, along with other tweaks that result from several years of production & feedback from the field -- i figured by the time i was ready to unload my car a much superior version would be available. what i got instead was the cancellation of the manual altogether, and the ls itself not long after. this is a car with an aluminum hood & front fenders, as well as suspension parts, anti-dive suspension, ventilated rear discs (ten consecutive stops from high speed with no fade) & a number of other things that caught my fancy & convinced me lincoln/ford was serious about the car. oh well.anyway, refinement, incremental improvement & fixing what breaks is what makes a superior product -- not throwing the whole damn thing out every five years or so and starting over. i still enjoy my ls, but would never buy another american car in this class, even though the cts does have merit. fool me once. . .i prefer to deal with an automobile company that takes sports  sedan  (& wagons) seriously and has done so for decades.

louiswei,7-Mar," hi guys, was away for 2 weeks and wow, this place is busier than ever. however, i see that the topics being discussed here haven't changed much...after taking a week to read all the posts, a thought has surfaced in my mind and i thought i'd share it with you guys. i think generally speaking we can break the ellps buyers into 2 groups:group 1: those whom are looking for a pure performance car which also can serve as a daily driver. people in this group tended to opt for manual tranny, sports package but usually not so hot on the luxury items.group 2: those whom are looking for a car that's a little sportier, a little faster, a little more luxurious and a little better looking (subjective i know) than the regular midsize 4-door  sedan . people in this group tended to opt for auto tranny and usually won't push their  car  to the limit nor track their  car .i personally think it's silly to count any worthy candidate out of contention because of reasons such as lack of auto tranny, fwd and softer ride than the benchmark ( bmw ). the reason why this segment is booming is because now-a-day there are so many different choices in the market so almost everybody out there could find one for his/her liking.ah, it's good to be back...

dpalmer2,7-Mar, so you find the  chevrolet  and the new cts to be similar? interesting. i would suspect less savvy people would be hard pressed to know the two interiors came from the same company. i respect the honesty you are displaying here. i find it quite interesting that one could hate car brands so much. you seem to have serious grudge againt anything american as regards to  car . so i assume based on your comments that you see no difference between gm  car  (or even cadillacs specifically) in 1987 and 2007. cant say that i agree but its a free country.dave 
chavis10,7-Mar,"  audi 's chassis and structure are based on a $15k economy car (as as was the old tt). i don't see how that's luxurious. my point to you all is that if i'm gonna pay the premium for a near lux car, it'd better have something to make it more special than a loaded  nissan  besides intangible things as   ""  kia hyundai nice chassis and solid f dodge e.

joe131,7-Mar," i don't remember how many passes they make during the tests, but i do remember reading an explanation of the testing procedures. my recollection is that they are uniform and cons toyota ent and done so direct comparisons of  car  are meaningful. road and track and car & driver test results are usually very close in numbers for the same car. they do not mollycoddle the  car . if the best times are achieved dumping the clutch at 4000 rpm on a manual or holding the brake while revving the motor on an auto trans car, that's how they launch them, even if it is hard on the car. that's why their times are always better than consumer reports.

joe131,7-Mar," why even care if it is real or fake aluminum? or wood?aluminum oxidizes very quickly so it must be coated with plastic anyway. so even if you get real aluminum in your car it is real plastic that you touch and feel. and what would be so good about the feel of real aluminum anyway? aluminum is not so pretty to look at. it is just gray. so what? and if they add fake grain effects to the aluminum, why not just make it real plastic to begin with? the plastic may be easier and less expensive to make and form into the pieces. that does not make it bad.same idea with fake (real plastic) wood and real wood. the real wood is filled, sanded, polished and then coated with real plastic varnish or overlay, so why not just use real plastic instead of wood to begin with? if the manufacturers use real wood, they do everything they can to make the wood look like plastic, then they coat it with real plastic besides! so again, what you touch is real plastic, not the real wood underneath.real wood is not so dimensionally stable, impervious to mo toyota ure and uniformly strong as modern plastics, so wood has a tendency to split, crack, shrink and expand which causes it to lose (in most people's opinions) its beauty eventually, and quicker than modern plastics would.photographic images or art toyota s' interpretations of real wood can be placed on real plastic so accurately that even an expert would have a hard time telling the difference.so what's the big deal?

brightness04,7-Mar," interest is something that ex toyota s whether you finance (therefore pay) or have the money in the bank (therefore collect). i have never financed a car, always a cash buyer or taking advantage of lease deals. lately what i have been realizing is that with interest between 5-6% on money market accounts over $50k, i'd be losing $200/mo interest income if i put $40k cash towards a car sitting in my garage instead of leaving the money in the bank. . . making some of the lease deals, like i mentioned before, very attractive. "
brightness04,7-Mar," trading a cash bought car every few years like i have been doing is definitely a money losing proposition in the current environment. keeping a car for 10 years is starting to make less sense too. for example, $30k in the bank earns an interest income of nearly $150/mo; leasing a  bmw  with ed costs only $277/mo with no cap reduction. how many months would it take for the $127/mo difference to add up to $30k that a cash buyer has to put down initially? hmm, 236 months, or close to 20 years! one has to keep the car well over a decade before it breaks even. i will chalk up lease inception cost and additional excise tax if any(not sales tax) against maintenance cost. there is no advantage in sales tax for buyer either because at $277/mo, it would take a decade to add up to $30k, which would also be taxable for a cash buyer.financing is of course even worse off than cash buying as the bank usually charges higher interest than it pays out in interest, the number of which was used above.btw, i know it's very odd. i have no idea how long those lease subsidizers can keep the charade up.

habitat1,7-Mar," careful on the lease analysis vs. cash buy analysis. what makes the most economic sense is dependent upon your own personal   ""  kia hyundai money factor  ""  kia hyundai  compared to the leasing companies, as well as what they claim the residual value is vs. what you think the depreciation will be. and, of course, what the capitalized cost is compared to the best negotiated cash price.bmw is known to have aggressive lease terms and i have not done a direct comparison. but my personal money factor is 3.5% (i can margin borrow at 6% and the interest is effectively tax deductable from my other investment earnings). that is not the case for many or most people, but i know of others who took out home equity loans at 5.5%-6.5% that were fully tax deductable interest. in the case of my 911, i compared the best lease deal i could get to my own   ""  kia hyundai self financed  ""  kia hyundai  purchase deal and the difference was enormous - to the tune of $21,000 over 48 months. i am sure the difference would be a closer with a  bmw , but i'm willing to bet that for those that can effectively borrow at an after tax rate of under 4%, it still is more expensive to lease than buy. there is no voodoo in leasing economics - you are adding another party to the equation and they need to make money. unless they can give me funds at under 4%, they will be making it at my expense - even without their little acquisition and dispositon fees.

wale_bate1,7-Mar," there seems to be, and rightly so, imo, some debate here on what exactly the ellps class comprises. as new entries land on our shores, or hopefully are developed here, the indentified participants change.the  audi  is already part of the game, and not just in my opinion; we will finally get a 1-series here as well. both of those certainly fit the description and both are far more appealing to me (the bmw on paper) than anything currently being discussed in here, but that's my subjective view of course...

1487,7-Mar," a v8 powered 540 weighs considerably more than an is300 or 325i. teh difference is probably around 500lbs which is significant. compare the weight of the  pontiac 5 or cts (which is kind o heavy) to the 3 series. the difference isn't that large, especially between the  pontiac 5 and 3. same goes for tl and 3 series. a couple hundred pounds between the  car  at most.

"
1487,7-Mar, the 3 is one heavy car for a compact so i dont know that i would uplift it as a model of weight savings. most  car  180inches long weigh far less than 3500lbs. the  honda  is a compact and i believe it weighs less than 3000lbs. if you want joyous feel i think a miata or mini is the way to go. 
blueguydotcom,7-Mar," 330i is a 2006 model.  volkswagen  gli as far back as 2002 had a 6 speed. fwiw, you can buy used luxury  car  and save thousands too. we bought a 30k msrp audi last week for 8k off sticker. the car's perfect, only has 12k miles on it and remaining 4 yr/50k warranty. we paid less than we would have plunked down for an 07  honda   honda  v6 (the 4 cylinder is so grossly underpowered it's not even close to equivalent). you like  bmw ? consider a 2006 325/330i at the end of 07. the 330is will be down around 30k (they're selling in the low 30s right now) and the 325is sub 25k by then for certain. i've already seen lightly used 2006 325is with premium/auto for 26k.i do agree about pricing for most of the  car . but once i drive a rwd vehicle i know that's worth a big chunk of dough over a bland fwd midsize car.

"
jtla,7-Mar," well, some cost components were missing in your calculation. i will copy and paste my post #9147 again:... two items were missed in your example: $695 destination charge and $625 lease inception fee (assuming rolled-in). my calculation based on:  - $28,415 ed invoice for base  bmw  sedan  infiniti  no option - $1,000 dealer profit + $625 lease fee - zero cap cost reduction - single security deposit - 2 yr / 12k miles lease - mf .00125 + 0.0003 for ed - 73% residual  using lease calculator from leaseguide.com the monthly payment comes to $354.55 with 7.75% sales tax. the march price bump probably adds $2 or $3 to the payment.in addition, doing ed for a base model may not worth it because there is not that much price gap with us prices, especially nowadays you can get the  bmw  for around $500 over invoice at local dealers. when you factor in the travel cost for ed and one month payment without your car (overall 2 months without car but bmwfs pays for the second month), the true monthly cost is about $400/month, which you can get from dealer lots without too much haggle.again, i agree that the  bmw  lease deal is very attractive, but it can't be had for $277/mo with no cap cost reduction. imo, the $123 (44%) difference is significant for cost comparison purpose. "
blueguydotcom,7-Mar, agreed. a nicely loaded  bmw  is the best deal for ed. you get a cut on every option you add so your base is actually further from the car's msrp and thus closer to the vehicle's residual value. 
hauss,7-Mar, don't forget that the new dodge  dodge  was off limits as were all the aston martin vehicles. i know aston martin's cost a pretty penny but i was sitting right in the cockpit of an  bmw  convertible at $120k and bmw didn't seem to care. heck i saw 5 year olds scaling the  seat  in a $80k land rover! let us in the  car  unless it's a one of a kind concept vehicle or something. 
brightness04,7-Mar," there is destination charge for new  hyundai , too. i don't count lease acquisition because maintenance cost of a  hyundai , including tire and brakes probably add up to more than $800 every two years. the original tires can probably last two years (althought definitely not three with my wife driving; that's why i'm not interested in three-year lease).is ed mf boosted by 0.0003 or 0.003? that's a sizable difference considering the vanishingly small base numbers that we are talking about :-) "
brightness04,7-Mar," i doubt a fender bender on a bmw would cost less, unfortunately. the last time i took my 5 series in (three  car  before my current  car ), the body shop guys literally had dollar signs in their eyes. "
blueguydotcom,7-Mar," yes, all ed mf's are boosted by 0.0003. of course, bmw pays for month two of the lease. any jump in cost is offset by the payment. i think the boost in mf has more to do with lining the pockets of dealers. "

brightness04,7-Mar," sales tax is something different from state to state, and something you can not avoid even if buying a  hyundai  (probably far worse for buying  hyundai  because you'd have to pay sales tax on the whole car). same goes with destination charge. the average maitenance cost on a  hyundai  probably exceeds $800 every two years, so there's no point counting lease inception charge either. i never roll either fees into lease payment. nor should they, or tax, be counted if we want an apples to apples comparison. of course, personally i agree with you that a loaded car is even better deal with ed; personally nothing short of a  bmw  convertible is really worth my time taking the trip (i'm actually planning on picking up two  car  to make flying the mrs worth it) . . . but we have to compare the cheapest deals avaiable just for the sake of argument.delivery time for east coast is one month, and bmwfs pays for that one month. $400/mo is worse deal than what bmw advertises on its own website. i'm sure if you are willing to over-pay, say $100,000 for a  hyundai , the dealer won't haggle with you much either ;-) "

brightness04,7-Mar,"  as for the  bmw  vs.  hyundai  cost discussion? are you guys serious?!!! well, the numbers are factually correct. it is indeed cheaper to get a 3 series than getting a  hyundai . i'm making that business decision precisely because a 3 series is cheaper to keep for a couple years than a  toyota  or  honda ! may as well give my employees a little incentive that doesn't cost me any extra, actually saving a few pennies even after counting the trip cost, which makes the european trip tax-writable.as for whether cost is relevent, if someone wants to disqualify  acura  on cost ground, we may as well examine what the real costs are for the other entries.

blueguydotcom,7-Mar, i've become accustomed to not paying for anything but my car payment and tires in regard to maintenance. it's hard to fathom paying for an oil change or worse some kind of maintenance/repairs. when i look at my bmw leases they cost me precisely my payment and new tires. i look at edmunds' true-cost-to own and i get a good laugh.

jtla,7-Mar," you may choose to pay destination charge, lease inception fee, and sales tax up front instead of by monthly payment, but these costs still ex toyota . similarly, there is travel expenses involved, even if you have one million frequent flyer miles. the bottom line is, the true monthly cost to lease a  bmw  for 2 yr/12k mile is approx. $370 before tax, $400 after tax.imho, saying that one can lease a  bmw  for $277/mo with no cap cost reduction, and thus a better deal than a  hyundai  is like false advertising. you would need to add fine print as (1) $2,100 up front cost to cover destination charge, lease inception, and sales tax; (2) $900 in travel expenses to munich to pick up your car. total $3,000 divided by 24 is $125. add that to $277 you get $402.speaking of ad, the deal on bmw website is $329/mo with $2,500 down payment. it includes auto transmission ($1,210 option) but only 10k miles per year (1% residual difference), the effect to payment is about a wash. the true monthly cost is about $400 before tax. my example in previous post is $400 after tax. "
jtla,7-Mar," sorry, didn't see louiswei's and your post earlier. this isn't really about lease or ed question. i just can't see people using misleading payment figure and compare  bmw  with  hyundai . anyway, i made my point, so i will just continue to enjoy reading all the fine posts on this forum.

brightness04,7-Mar," destination charge, lease inception vs. maitenance cost and sales tax all ex toyota  even if you decide to buy a  hyundai . the $23000 msrp suggested included none of that. if you really want to grind through the numbers including all the ancillary numbers, here we go for  hyundai  with cash purchase:invoice +$200profit: $21,732  (remember i gave the bwm dealer $1000 profit)destination fee $6507.7% sales tax: $1723maintenance in yea subaru  and yea subaru , per edmunds: $1005total out of pocket: $25110compare to leasing  bmw  via ed:placing that $25110 that would have paid for the  hyundai  in treasury bills at 5-6% becomes at least $27684 (at 5%) after two yearseven at $300/mo (go plug in the numbers yourself),  24mo is only $6900 (bmwfs pays one monty)destination: $700lease inception: $625disposal charge: $325flight and one-night accommodation: $1000 + $150 (just to be generous)total out of pocket: $9700so after two years, $27684 - 9700 = $17984do you honestly believe that a two year old hyundai  hyundai  can resell for $17984? the case is not even close. not sure why you even bother debating me on this. even if you tag on another $50/mo to fatten the dealer, do you believe a 2-year old  hyundai  can sell for $16750? the number is the same if you ins toyota  on $400/mo but wipe off the euro trip allowance of $1150 above. like i  toyota d, the numbers are not even close; why do you even bother to debate me on this? frankly if you ins toyota  on $400/mo, we should recaculate and use msrp+$5000 for the  hyundai  as apparently the hypothetical consumer is fond of paying more than the manufacturer suggested price.

"
blueguydotcom,7-Mar," you're totally ignoring your other costs so you can arrive at a fallacious magic number. the fact is a bmw lease is going to add on the $625 acquisition fee, 1 month payment without use of the car, cost to retrieve car and cost to replace car after only 22 months in service. these costs cannot be ignored if you're performing any real cost analysis. over the course of 24 months even at your fake $300 a month rate (multiplied by 23), you're looking at:lease cost $6900 (but only 22 months of use)extra cost: $625retrieval cost: $1200 (bare minimum as there's also transportation costs in munich)tire replacement cost: $1000 (with 30k miles there's no way the car's rfts will be in good enough shape to return the car with same shoes)9725/22 months of use = $442 per month and the other two months you will have to pay for something else...add in gas expenditures too! a  bmw  can reasonably get 21 mpg combined using 2008 standards. 15k miles / 21 mpg = 714 gallons per year. premium gas is at least $3 a gallon. that's $2142 per year on just gas.

brightness04,7-Mar," i simply answered a rhetoric question by stating that i would pick a  bmw  over a $24k  hyundai  on pure cost consideration, because leasing a  bmw  would cost a lot less than paying $24k for a  hyundai . if you don't care about  hyundai  and more importantly can't be bothered with simple arithmatics, you should have thought through before accusing me of anything.  bmw  can be leased at sub-$300/mo without any capital reduction. every lease comes with acquisition fee; tax, title, insurance and gas are extra for any car, lease or purchase . . . almost all  car  excepting bmw's also incurr maintenance expense. there is nothing misleading about it. i don't waste my time in business where my markup is only 10%. on the other hand, bmw dealers are quite willing to fill some paperwork for you for a $1000 profit without any cutting into their allocation. the numbers i mentioned already included $1000 profit for the car dealer.

louiswei,7-Mar," i don't know about you hauss, i was actually enjoying the   ""  kia hyundai  bmw  vs. the world debate  ""  kia hyundai . :pas matter of fact, i'll start a little   ""  kia hyundai  bmw  vs. all-other-ellps debate  ""  kia hyundai  myself. note: this is coming from a non-enthusiast (at least not about tracking the car) and interior nut's point of view. oh, by the way, this will also not be a price independent discussion. bmw  vs. tl: drawtl has the class-leading design in interior and best value in class but it's fwd.  bmw  has a not-so-desirable interior but is good in power and handling with the rwd advantage. this could go either way depend on how important is the fwd/rwd criteria to the buyers. bmw  vs.  audi :  bmw audi  audi  is outdated, underpowered and overweight. the only advantage it held over  bmw  is the better looking interior but that, also looks like it belongs in the last generation which the  audi , uh..., is. bmw  vs. cts (current):  bmw hands down  bmw  in this case. the only advantage the caddy has is the bigger interior space but to me that is mute since we are talking about ellps instead of midsize sedan here. not going to comment about the 08' cts since it is not yet available and details are still waiting to be revealed. bmw  vs.  pontiac 5:  pontiac 5 pontiac 5 has better value, nicer looking interior, rock-solid handling and one of the top engines in this segment. the engine does not have the   ""  kia hyundai kick  ""  kia hyundai  that the twin-turbo 6 in the  bmw  has but is decent enough. with the comparable equipped  pontiac 5s and  bmw  having a price difference around $6-8k (msrp, let's not go to that ed discussion here again please) i'll take that over 0.5 seconds faster in 0-60 any given day. only thing lacking in the  pontiac 5 is the inferior material used inside the cabin. bmw  vs. is350: is350is350 has a good interior, better in design than  bmw  and materials used are equally good if not better. it's engine might not be as   ""  kia hyundai torquey  ""  kia hyundai  as the twin-turbo 6 in the low rpm region but is the only one that could hang with it in this segment. to me, i couldn't notice much difference between the 2 with the is350 on   ""  kia hyundai power ect mode  ""  kia hyundai . i am pretty sure a few tenth of a second difference is there but unless one is in a drag race that is really a non-issue. the comparable equipped is350 is about $2-3k lower than the  bmw  so the value factor is still there if one must. the only disadvantage for the is350 is its more isolated steering and not-as-sharp handling. bmw  vs.    mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  :  bmw the current    mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz   is outdated, over-priced so this one goes to  bmw  hands down. i doubt if the new c could fair better since we know it's a m-b that means it will be over-priced. also, even the new c350 is considered   ""  kia hyundai under-powered  ""  kia hyundai  in today's ellps segment.

1487,7-Mar, thanks for clearing that up! 
brightness04,7-Mar," the factory original tires usually last between 30-35k miles for me. on the other hand the brakes wear out between 20-30k. my current car had to replace the brakes at 21k miles, at a cost of $990, an expense that would have been avoided with bmw's, regardless leasing or buying.22.5mo vs. 23mo is only 2% difference, quite immaterial. "
brightness04,7-Mar," very much in agreement with your assessment on the vehicles themselves. the value issue however gets very murky nowadays. i am actually picking the 3 series over tl and  pontiac 5 on pricing alone. the extra volume of tl and  pontiac 5 actually would have been nice in our case, but the price is what sells. even witout ed, the high residual and low money factor actually make the 3 series cheaper than tl and  pontiac 5, or at least comparable in the case of tl. let's not forget, over 80% of new 3 series are leased, and a vanishingly small per centage of people pay msrp even if they buy. so the pricing issue is much trickier than just looking at msrp.for what it's worth, i actually did a cost analysis over 6 year period ( car  more than 6 years old are crap shoots, or at least have the   ""  kia hyundai luxury  ""  kia hyundai  and   ""  kia hyundai sport  ""  kia hyundai  squeezed out of them). having three brand new 3 series over 6 years beats having 1 tl, 2 tl, 3 tl or 1  pontiac 5, 2  pontiac 5, 3  pontiac 5 over the same 6 year projection hands down in dollars and cents alone. shorter assessment periods would make bmw's margin of victory in this low-cost race even greater because the maintenance cost is paid by the manufacturer for the first 4 years.

hauss,7-Mar," 1487, i'm not a  bmw  fan myself. i still contend that if it were far and away the best choice in this class it would have far greater market share than it does. it does have the largest market share among the ellps (and i'm not counting the coupes and convertibles they sell just the  sedan ) but not by a landslide. it's more like a few percentage points. if you add up all the other ellps sales the  bmw  is not the choice of vehicle for roughly 4 out of 5 ellps buyers. you just need to take your argument to them in a different way. for example, when they tell you things such as features are subjective then remind them that feel is subjective too. when the argument turns to value remind them that while a good chassis and suspension come at a cost so to do luxury features. just as they cannot do without a certain enthusiastic ride other buyers cannot do without feature content. for everyone that likes their  car  small there are those that require more size and space. finally, we can still argue, i think, the athleticism component too. we can easily dig up information that shows other  car  besting the 3 series over the years in performance metrics such as acceleration, handling, and braking. while the 3 series usually performs well in those tests it does not always finish first in all of them. let's use these type of arguments to stir up the debate. i think you'll find that many people aren't all that enamored with bmw's product.

brightness04,7-Mar," you are certainly correct on the rear seat volume. the use i have in mind for these  car  doesn't involve rear seat passengers. being a mid-size car,  pontiac 5 has significant advantage in trunk space, and especially the way it is accessed. that extra 9  ""  kia hyundai  car length was put to good use there. i know, it's a bit odd talking about trunk space, but hey, we all have real life requirements. if not for real life requirement, the driving enthusiasts among us would be looking at miata or z4 instead of a relatively porky 4-door. but, like i  toyota d, it's not a deal killer, with the discounting from bmwfs that i'd be getting, my employees will just have to put up with the occasional trunk loading difficulties, or even put some of the bigger pieces of equipment in the empty back seat for all i care; who knows, they might even be eager to do that if it means a car with the blue propeller on the hood :-) "

brightness04,7-Mar," different companies slice and dice the market a little differently. for example, bmw markets  bmw  sport package to the ellps segment with more sporty inclinations, and  bmw  premium package to the ellps segment with more luxury inclinations; mb is dividing c into c350 sport vs. c280 luxury; lexus approaches the market with is and es (i know what the detractors would say, but with 270+ hp, performance certainly is a design factor even if handling is far from the top priority). we really don't want to bring in too much of their platform mates that are not  sedan  in here, lest we end up talking about a myriad vehicles with very different characterisitcs. "
brightness04,7-Mar," it used to be a sport coupe thing (triumph, 911, celica/supra, 240sx/300zx, mitsu 3000,  acura , miata etc.) bmw accomplished a remarkable thing in the 70's and 80's by making a four door sedan to do that, and the market place rewarded it handsomely. nowadays quite a few competitors are catching on to this; e.g.  pontiac 5, tl, is, etc.. the difference between the current  pontiac 5, tl and is vs. 3 series in that regard is probably less than the difference between difference between various generations of 3 series. among bmw's, the biggest jump was made from e30 to e36, when the rear suspension was radically modified to make rear tracking better. most mfrs in this segment use multi-link rear suspensions nowadays.

"
brightness04,7-Mar," i agree with you that tl and  acura  have similar, if not slightly superior real life resale. however, lease residuals offered by manufacturers are not determined by real life resale but by the manufacturers' eagerness to ush new  car  and bend accounting books. right now, for the month of march 2007, the 24/24 residual on 3 series sedan is 73%, that of the tl is only 68%, and tl type-s is only 66%. the 5-7% difference there is huge because if you can get the car for 90% msrp, the 3 series lease would only amortize 17% of msrp over two years, whereas the tl would be amortizing 22%-24% of msrp. tl msrp would have to be 33% lower to make the amortization amount equal; fat chance of that :-) like i  toyota d, the phenomenom of bmwfs giving out free fake money in the form of lease residual, fake but good for car payments on bmw's, is changing the cost equation d dodge aticly. "
brightness04,7-Mar, it's a simple statement that people can buy bmw's for all sorts reasons other than being involved in sporty driving. 
brightness04,7-Mar," okay, you got me there. i meant tot say that they are _only_ 3-4 years out of date. the rationale being that tl is on a 4-yr model cycle, and the new one is coming out next year. by your reckoning, they are only perhaps a couple years being surpassed by new competition. i may even be inclined to agree with you on that. it furthers my argument that this segment is evolving really fast, and the previous generation products from each and everyone of the manufacturers (including bmw) can not hold candle to the latest competition. that's why i suggested that if we want cost to be partof the analysis at all, it has to be based on cost associated with rapid fleet update . . . because after 3-4 (or even 2 years), we are no longer talking about a competitive ellps vis. the new competition. "
hauss,7-Mar," that's fine for discussion of vehicles in general but since this is a sedan discussion the fact that bmw make coupes and convertibles is irrelevant to how their 3 series sedan compares to its competition.  so, my argument is not about their product line in general but about their sedan and this forum. "
fedlawman,7-Mar," of course, if you want to have a new car every 2 or 3 years, and don't mind always having a car payment, then bmw does make the money cheap.but that's the only scenario where it pays off. paying $10,000 every 2 years for the benefit of having a brand new car every 2 years isn't cheap. at the end of 6 years, you've paid out $30,000 and own nothing.i know it's apples and oranges (leasing is a great solution for many people - business owners especially), but personally, i'd rather pay cash and own the car outright. i'll keep the car as long as i want, and then pass it on to my kids if it's a good one (like my v70). "
blueguydotcom,7-Mar," hat's why i suggested that if we want cost to be partof the analysis at all, it has to be based on cost associated with rapid fleet update . . . because after 3-4 (or even 2 years), we are no longer talking about a competitive ellps vis. the new competition.i wouldn't agree with that at all. the ellps is bloating and numbing at an alarming pace. evolution usually implies improvement in the function of a species. ellps today v. an e46 (1998 chassis) - no contest, the e46. the only things my e46 zhp sedan really lacked were power, weight reduction and an lsd - the  bmw 's engine and lsd would have solved two of those. to each his own. "
brightness04,7-Mar," well, e36 fans  toyota d the same thing about e46, and in turn were ridiculed by e30 fans who liked the jumpy rear end. actually, e46 started the trend of bloat, by borrowing suspension geometry from e40 5 series, in order to get a smooth ride than smothers out pot holes.when lexus tried to l toyota en to the   ""  kia hyundai real enthusiasts  ""  kia hyundai  and put forth the is300, which was more in common to e30 than e46 was in terms of driving  toyota mics and riding quality, the market place gave it a big thumb-down. that pretty much proved that not only people don't always buy bmw's for performance; the   ""  kia hyundai real enthusiasts  ""  kia hyundai  are not even in the driver's seat in terms of new car sales. "
blueguydotcom,7-Mar," fed, pay out 30k over 6 years on any of the ellps  car  and you still don't own anything. it'll take another 10-15k to pay off one of those. so after 40k and 8 years you might own an ellps and it'll be worth about 6-7k. just keeping 40k in the bank would work out better (about 59k).  "
blueguydotcom,7-Mar," i'd say the original is failed more on the poor power, origins, bad gas mileage, boy racer exterior/interior. it was hard to get past the boy-racer feel of the car and the fact lexus wanted 30k+ for a rebadged toyota with little power and 18 mpg. "

"
brightness04,7-Mar," exactly! you took the words right out of my mouth. when a lease deal is amortizing only 17% of msrp over 24 months, it means the buyer would have to keep the car some 11 years to make depreciation outlay comparable. that's not even counting any repair and maintenance cost (which are none for the first 24mo, but sizable if not huge for bmw's over 5 years old). then there's the subsidized lease money factor that is lower than interest that one can collect at a bank. "
brightness04,7-Mar," well, e30 would very much be a boyracer compared to e46 and e90. 200hp was about what most e36 and e46 had (some as low as 168hp), much more than what typical e30 had. pedigree, well, that's for pets :-) "
brightness04,7-Mar," i have shared that conventional wisdom with you for much of my driving life. all my  car , excepting one, were paid with cash. that view is being severely challenged in recent years in the face of vendor financing. blueguy has it well covered from the financial perspective. i just want to point out also that, after a model cycle (or even less), whatever we buy today would be either a boyracer or a family car by the standards of that time, not really ellps so even if had cost less it would be an apples-to-oranges comparison. thankfully, we don't even have to choose between money and being to date nowadays; a bit odd, yes.

louiswei,7-Mar," let's leave the bimmer alone for a minute shall we... :p when i was   ""  kia hyundai taking care of business  ""  kia hyundai  yesterday at the house i saw the february issue of the r&t laying around so i picked it up and start reading the japanese   ""  kia hyundai sporty  sedan   ""  kia hyundai  comparison for the second time. although i generally agree with the verdict but would like to share my point of view since i did test drive both the  pontiac 5s, tl-s before and currently own an is350.my ranking:3. tl-spros:- good value. although the sticker is at $38k, one can easily get one for around $35k which is a lot of car (and gadget) for that price.- confident handling for a fwd.- best interior in terms of design in this segment.- optional manual transmissioncons:- nose heavy feeling. this is obvious since it's a fwd and probably wouldn't bother too many people whom moved up from their current mid-sizer.- lack of power in terms of competition. 280hp and some change is definitely not weak but since its major competitors are all in the 300 range, it could certainly use some boost in this department.- interior cost cutting. fake cf, fake wood, low quality material for door panel handles. nothing major but worth mentioning imo.bottom line: excellent car as a mid-sizer step up and good ellps but don't pay msrp for it.2.  pontiac 5spros:- improved interior over the previous model. the new interior looks elegant, especially the washi aluminum trim.- best handling in all japanese ellps.- good value. similar equipped, it is considerably cheaper than competitors, japanese or not.- optional manual transmission.cons:- interior cost cutting. hard plastic being used for lower part of the door panel. this issue is not major but shouldn't happen for a car that's in the $30k-40k range.- strange position for control buttons. infiniti decided they are better off facing upward instead forward (or to the drive). why? i don't know.- the new vq. although rated at 306hp, it is slower than toyota's 2gr-fse and bmw's twin-turbo 6 in terms of both driving feel and stat toyota ic. lack the low rpm boost. bottom line: excellent performance sedan for the price and if you are a so-called   ""  kia hyundai enthusiast  ""  kia hyundai  with a preference of japanese make this is the one to get.1. is350pros:- one of the best interiors in this segment. material used is top-notch, excellent fit-and-finish- smooth and powerful v6. the 306hp 2gr-fse is capable to push the car from 0-60 in less than 5 seconds  honda ing to r&t and that's faster than an audi s4. this car is wicket fast in ect sports mode.- lots of standard gadgets.- good balance between sporty and luxury.- smooth 6-speed auto trannycons:- no manual tranny available.- tight interior space.- cheap (although not cheap looking) metallic trim instead of real aluminum.- handling not as crisp as the competition, has more isolated steering feel.- intrusive vdim system. it's good that on the 2007 model lexus decided to put a vdim-off switch. too bad that us 06' owners still have to resort to the   ""  kia hyundai tap dancing  ""  kia hyundai  method.bottom line: offers excellent balance between performance and luxury, argubly one of the best   ""  kia hyundai all-around  ""  kia hyundai  entry-level luxury performance sedan on the market. as long as one doesn't race it on the track.

1487,7-Mar," i agree about the  pontiac 5 interior, the press have given it a free ride on this but its hardly class leading. i found all sorts of hard plastic and slightly cheap touches inside. the look is fine, but the details are not up to lexus or bmw standards. same applies to the tl although to a lesser extent. i was also surprised the g has fixed rear headrests which isnt something you commonly find in japanese  sedan . "
hauss,7-Mar," overall a nice review. here are other comments from my vantage point:tl-s: best interior ergonomics among the three. most spacious of the 3. worst looking wheels among the three. also, it's a shame they don't offer 18  ""  kia hyundai  factory wheel option (you can get them dealer installed). best stereo among the three. auto tranny should be 6 speed.  pontiac 5: interior ergonomics have improved but are still poor for a car in this segment. interior design is choppy compared to tl and is350 but is much improved over last generation. for a car of it's size (exterior) the interior is a bit c dodge ped.is350: most expensive of the 3. aside from hard plastic on grip side door panel handles are same material as tl-s (ru toyota er). "
louiswei,7-Mar, best stereo among the three.have you compare tl's stereo to is's mark levison? i have to admit that i am not big into stereo systems but it'll be nice to find out why one is better than the others. 
hauss,7-Mar," i was going by the general standard ster volkswagen  with my comment but to your point the premium mark levinson systems lexus uses are  hyundai  and just as good as acura's els surround sound system. lexus l toyota s it as a stand alone option but that's really only if you're willing to special order the vehicle that way. i think the option packages it comes with is about $3800. plus, you'll likely have a hard time finding one with just that option package - there will be other options included. that drives up the price. in my experience the only is350s i've seen with the mark levinson stereo are well into the $40k's. so, that's why i'd say the tl stereo is better based on the cost factor and that it's in every vehicle.

habitat1,7-Mar," those things are getting pretty reliable now-a-day which they don't break as much often.maybe you are right, but my experience isn't great - our 2005  acura  had to have the navigation control unit (dvd reader under the passenger seat) replaced twice, first when it placed us in the atlantic ocean on the way home from boston and then when it just froze up. and, as i  toyota d, my 911 is in the shop because the power passenger seat stopped working in an unusable far forward position. no manual override to push it back.  i've also heard of some malfunctioning bluetooth / voice activated electronics in both lexus and acura. royal pain in the butt for a   ""  kia hyundai mechanic  ""  kia hyundai  to try to figure out what the problem is. and complete replacement of these systems is not cheap when it's out of warranty. a complete nav system replacement (including screen) would probably approach the grand total of all maintence and repairs on my  nissan  in 155k miles (under $3,500, including 38 oil changes).i admit that the gadget craze is here to stay with respect to ellps. especially since there seem to be a lot more folks concerned about   ""  kia hyundai l  ""  kia hyundai  than   ""  kia hyundai p  ""  kia hyundai . i recall someone in this forum even claiming not offering ventilated  seat  as   ""  kia hyundai unacceptable  ""  kia hyundai  in this segment. but along with this gadgetry comes a lot of premature obsolescence given how long the actual car could last. that 12 year old 993 model 911 sure looked great to me, in spite of none of the accutriments that are required in sub-ellps today. and it could still kick the butt of almost any pure   ""  kia hyundai p  ""  kia hyundai  car in any segment.

brightness04,7-Apr," the vette ride quality improved d dodge aticly too in those 20 years. the new vette is actually quite a smooth ride on highways. imho, the difference tex mentioned in vette vs. 3 series is that:1. just like mariner mentioned, vette hasn't changed much in vehicle size whereas the 3 series today is bigger than 5 series of 20 years ago. in fact, the wheelbase of today's 3 series is nearly half a foot longer than the wheelbase of 5 series of 20 years ago. the europeans are finally making american sized  car  because they are no longer facing material shortage (relative to labor) like they did decades ago. the european/british sportscar tradition was literally born of a necessity after wwii when they had little natural resources but a lot of mouths to feed; they had to make something to trade for food import, turning import steel to  car  was one of the solutions. that's why the value to weight ratio of those  car  had to be high (becaue much of the raw material for buildings  car  had to be im toyota d too); hence very small  car  at relatively high price, and   ""  kia hyundai sportiness  ""  kia hyundai  was sold those  car .2. vette is a technological and engineering tour-de-force. everything is tried to save an ounce here and an ounce there. i'm not even sure if gm makes any money on making vette; it's the halo car for the company. on the other hand, 3 series is the main source of income for bmw. bean-counting decisions have to be made for such a bread-and-butter car (for bmw). for example, making the body shell out of aluminum or fiber/graphite composite material instead of good old heavy steel sheet metal is simply out of question for the regular 3 series.

plekto,7-Apr," i have the perfect solution.since a cayman(which i adore, btw) is a chunk of money, you want to save every penny that you can until then. you are the perfect poster-child for a three year lease.(with one exception - see below)a 2007 cadillac cts can be had for $299 a month.the bmw  bmw  is ~$399 a month, give or take.(yes both deals are insanely low - someone's losing money somewhere)you can also get an audi  audi  for $299 a month - or at least that's what the local dealer has on the car window. there are some insane lease deals out there on  car  right now.(let alone things like $189 a month on an  honda /wv/etc - all about the same)go cheap, save your pennies. then get the cayman. *the exception is to buy a mini. it suffers about $1000 a year in depreciation, due to silly pent-up demand and cult-like status. the new one fits 2 kids in the rear well enough(even two car  seat !) of course, buy a base model with little on it to maximize your return/minimize accessory value loss) "
blueguydotcom,7-Apr," most of those lease deals require money down to pay down the cap cost. every $1000 drops the payment by about $15-17.also most require an acquisiton cost (usually over $495) and a return fee ($250 and up). all the fees add up. leases can be a good deal but they can also devour you slowly if you're not careful. most people leasing never bother to learn the lease money factors/residuals or how all of that plays into the lease rate. i know far too many people who lease by asking for   ""  kia hyundai the deal.

brightness04,7-Apr," i totally agree with you on the general sentiment. lately, however, something very weird is going on. it's as if some of the luxury brands are caught up in some kind of discount selling frenzy. cts can indeed be had for $299 with no money down (big surprise to me too), and  bmw  local lease (no ed) is being advertized for $129/mo with $5500 down (which works out to be $360-370/mo or so with no money down). it's getting to the point where ed may not be worth the time unless one is picking up a loaded  bmw  or higher. for example, one of my local dealers is http://www.herbchambers.com where they are showing both deals mentioned above.it's getting a little out of hand. perhaps the luxury brands expanded their capa honda  so much in the past few boom years that they are now having to sell at marginal cost (i.e. at a price point that does not help defraying r&d cost) just to keep the factories going. that's typical of industries that are heavy on capital investment and low on marginal cost; the classic example being the airlines . . . every producer/supplier can lose a boat load of money very quickly in a price war in an industry like that.

designman,7-Apr," don't believe that too many people even get close to 7/10ths on public roads. that's probably true but there are situations where they do. for instance, when the throttle is put to the floor on curves, fwd is a bummer. in that situation, the more torque there is, the worse it is as far as steering is concerned. it feels like there's a little devil in the steering column fighting every move you make. fwd is contentious.

edwardsf,7-Apr," good point that a car's feel is important. another factor is how one drives a car as compared to how that car performs. i find it frustrating that so many on this forum either slavishly cite hp or similarly cite 0-60 as the only arbiter of performance.  car  with good 0-60 performance generally shoot out of the blocks and may or may not have good mid range power/torque. as opposed to soccer moms in suvs and mi chevrolet ns, i don't have any need for jetting off the line in suburbia (why do they do that anyway?). where i want power is: a) passing at 50 mph on the way up highway 50 in the sierra nevada, b) out of a country road curve at 35 mph, or c) merging on to a freeway. in socal, where you often have to accelerate from 40 to 75 quickly to safely merge on a freeway, 0-60 is meaningless. so unless a poster is referring to his ho toyota y of going out to the local race track to do time trials, i wish the hp and 0-60 stats would be shelved.

plekto,7-Apr," if you look at how they tend to do the tests, it's not real toyota ic at all in most cases. why? because manually shifting the automatic gearbox or revving it and dropping the clutch in *third gear* aren't typical driving patterns.more useful are the slalom and passing tests, because some  car  are slugs due to having a torque converter locked.(and again, manually down-shifting isn't kosher unless the car has a manu-matic.)about magazines, while i generally loathe consumer reports, their track test-data is very close to real-life since they don't play tricks to squeeze out a few tenths of a second.p.s. horsepower ratings are nearly meaningless unless we can also see it throughout the gears.

blueguydotcom,7-Apr," manually downshifting is a reality as most automatics will downshift too. the thing is, those of us driving manuals will do so far faster than an automatic or manumatic. except in the case of a dsg-equipped car. i've never been in 6th gear at 50 and decided to pass someone in 6th gear. 4th gear most likely and even then i'll dip to 3rd for passing.

""  kia hyundai that   ""  kia hyundai simple  ""  kia hyundai  subtraction will not produce anything close to the 50-70 times that are separately run, usually by keeping the car in top gear (or at least the same gear) in a manual transmission car. for example, i have the motor trend road test of a 911s and it shows 0-50 in 3.2 and 0-70 in 5.6, which would   ""  kia hyundai subtract  ""  kia hyundai  to a 50-70 in 2.4 seconds. they don't show a separate 50-70 time, but the ones i have seen are at least double that figure. mt also doesn't show their shift points, but i'm guessing that they are hitting 50 in 2nd gear and 70 in 3rd, shifting somewhere in the 60 mph range. if the actual 50-70 test was done in 6th, 5th or even 4th, you'd get much slower times than 2.4 seconds. if i were cruising along at 50 mph, i'd probably be in 4th or 5th rather than 6th, but i sure as heck wouldn't be cruising in 2nd at 6,000 rpm. bottom line is that everyone should do their own test drives. on the same note, although i own a 2004 tl 6-speed and it was rated as fast or faster than some of the top performing rwd ellps at the time, it takes a hell of a lot more practice to launch a fwd vehicle to a 6 second 0-60 sprint than, say, a rwd 330i. the fwd wheel hop, tire spinning and torque steer make achieving those times in a tl on  honda  streets a white knuckle experience compared to a relative walk in the park for a 3 series. and that's something i learned from my own extensive test drives, not reading mt or road and track. i bought the tl not to drag race at stoplights, but beacause of its well balanced set of attributes.

pv2,7-Apr," good points; nobody is holding 2nd at 60 just cruising along, so those figures wouldn't be totally accurate. i was trying to contrast the 50-70 times that are done by holding top gear, which is also unreal toyota ic if you're in a passing situation. in a manual you would clearly downshift one or two gears, so i think that doing the subtraction would give you a more real toyota ic approximation of what you would experience if you downshifted in a manual or let the automatic do it for you. having an auto equipped 2007 tl-s, i can say that the throttle is quite sensitive; if i press down a little i get no downshift; something more i get 4th and more than halfway down i get 3rd. it didn't take me long to figure out what the tranny would do. i sometimes use the manu-matic function and find that it shifts just a bit faster, probably due to software mods, but if i'm on the highway and need to pass, it's a bit easier and faster to just hit the gas pedal and let the tranny do the work.i do agree that everyone should do their own testing, but it would require an associate with a stopwatch to get any precision beyond   ""  kia hyundai seat of the pants  ""  kia hyundai . i also agree that any manual fwd car, including the tl would require some practice to get really good 0-60 times. the auto version would be a few ticks slower, but since it's equipped with traction control (n/a on the stick version) it's a little easier to get cons toyota ency. i too bought the tl-s for it's balanced attributes and excellent value for the price.

blueguydotcom,7-Apr," they claim it is more difficult to move a used manual transmission car,key words: they - salespeople - claim it. i've sold many manual  car . recently when i put my 330i manual on swapalease i had 9 people contact me to take over the lease (over 50 people contacted me with questions). it was a deluge of people and in every case they mentioned the manual transmission. kd and others who have sold bimmers privately can attest to the drawing power of the manual. never owned an automatic car and i always seem to sell my  car  quickly; this is probably because i'm getting manuals in fun-to-drive vehicles; my  car  attract enthusiasts.  and that given two [in this case bmw's] similar  car , the used awd car will command a higher resale price. it cost more to begin with, so naturally it will command a higher resale value. navi will also increase the used car price; but never forget it added tremendously to the purchase price. $2100 navi = 2262 cost to the first buyer. in ca. sell the car and get 1600 more because it had navi, well you just lost $600. was it worth it? if you are correct, however, why is it that it is virtually impossible to find a manual transmission german car these days?haven't had any  problem . but then again, i either order my  car  or buy versions intended for enthusiast's. my 03 330i  infiniti  was bought off the lot. bro-in-law's 03 325 was a manual too - off the lot. 06 330i was ordered. 07 cooper s was off-the-lot with a manual.  i believe automatic transmissions to be reliable.if you mean needing or repair at 120k instead of 80k, maybe. it's still extremely expensive to fix an auto tranny and getting pricier all the time. there is no sense in paying 1200 extra for something that could end up with a 4-5-6k bill later. the manual comes in the base price and at most it'll require a new clutch at 100-150k miles.have more to do with   ""  kia hyundai population density  ""  kia hyundai  in so many places taking the   ""  kia hyundai enjoyment  ""  kia hyundai  out of manually shifting while trying to check voice mail, drink a latte, prog dodge  the navigation system and fiddling with the   ""  kia hyundai joy stick  ""  kia hyundai  controls of so many of these  car .no l toyota uids allowed in the car, nothing to fiddle with (no cds, no navi) and phone is on bluetooth. i drive in la with manuals; it's not a big deal. like the unreliability of a bmw, i'll gladly take 85 % moments of unhappiness for 15% of bliss. i am wondering, however, if there would be evidence (and i'm not saying there is, so this is a hypothetical question) if there were evidence that automatic or awd didn't do some of the things you know to be negatives, if you would then consider switching?how could awd be lighter? it has more parts.how could it not impact fuel economy? it has more parts creating drag.how could awd be cheaper to maintain? it has more parts.replace awd with automatic and you get the same thing. just for kicks, if the choice of a 6 speed manual or 6 speed automatic was a $0.00 cost decision, or if the retained resale value of awd was higher (%) than, etc, and/or if repair costs for manuals were actually likely to be greater, etc -- would your mind change? or, are you really more about #1 than #2 and #3.manual repairs can't be higher, so the hypothetical has a logical fallacy.  frankly, for me, life's too short to drive a 2wd car and it would take a huge economic disincentive to stop honing in only on awd versions.to each his own.  finding a 335xi or 535xi stick shift to test drive will be darn near impossible -- so if the magic lease genie makes me a deal i can't refuse, i might be forced to order a car i can't test drive and take the chance (small though it would be) that the stick shift is unsatisfactory.it's a bmw so it's a given the car will have a lousy manual. but even a lousy manual is better than the cheapest, best automatic.

blueguydotcom,7-Jun," the 1 series can do a lot but not if they price it as high as  car  which will be more desirable to the average car buyer. i know, i know bmw isn't for everyone. but bmw wants to make money and they need new blood in the showrooms. the 1 series is small and will probably be a great car if they don't kill it with over pricing.i don't know what overpricing is for a bmw. the 3 series supposedly is overpriced yet they move 100k of them a year. 31-32k seems totally reasonable for a rwd performance coupe with 300 hp. i can't think of another coupe with rwd and 300+ hp for that kinda money.for me, if they had a 1 series sedan, i'd be at the dealership today putting down my deposit for a summer of 08 delivery (i'd do ed to save 4-5k off msrp). shrug, 32k seems like a steal for that kind of performance, luxury and quality. nothing else ex toyota s like it. "
habitat1,7-Jun," shrug, 32k seems like a steal for that kind of performance, luxury and quality. nothing else ex toyota s like it. i agree. i'm pretty sure it wouldn't match the 3 series in sales numbers given that it's more of a niche market, but i think it would do quite well. probably at least as well as bmw have done with the z4 which is also a niche market and where they face (imo) superior competition in the form of the lower priced honda s2000 and higher priced boxster s. the 1 series represents a niche that they could potentially dominate. "
qbrozen,7-Jun," 31-32k seems totally reasonable for a rwd performance coupe with 300 hp.i think steve and i have been on the same page on this one so far. and, yes, we both agree with you. but many folks here seem to think the car will be $35k, and that's the pricepoint at which it won't seem like a good deal.

plekto,7-Jun," well, pur toyota s who want a real 3 series of yore experience will get the 1 series with nothing but a stereo and ac. it'll be going out the door in stock form for a tad over 30k i bet.shoot, i remember my friend's 2002 in college. that's a real bmw and always will be. a 3600lb+ jellybean... my mother's 2000 lesabre weighs about the same as the new 3 series. no, really.park ave:39.5 ft turning circle112.2 wheelbase206.8 l x 73.5 wbmw  bmw 3593 lbs36.1 ft turning circle108.7 wheelbase178.2l x 71.5wlooks good so far, right?guess which one is which? this is the real shocker. 3593 lbs3591 lbs "
blueguydotcom,7-Jun," 35k is unreal toyota ic. that would make it 3k less than a  bmw . there's no way they're gonna price it that close to the 3. the gap between the 3-5-7 is much larger than that.if you're claiming 35k, then you're also saying the 128 will start at around 31k. that simply can't be. it'd be starting 1k lower than the  bmw . 26k-27k would put the 128 a few k over the cooper s and that'd leave the 135 to roll in at 31-32k. add sport and premium and the car is already at 35.5k then.

stevecebu,7-Jun," if you read through the 1-series discussion i posted a link to previously, there are others here who think quite differently, however.yes we agree, i was just posting to the read not just to an individual in this case. my bad. :blush: i think people can think whatever they want but when it comes to buy it that's when the tires hit the road.at least the guys who think it will sell for $35k will be able to get a few options with the extra money.  i think i am posting on 2 bmw groups for the 1 series and i think i have a 3 series group as well as some others.i've gotta add a couple more threads and remove a few as well.

fedlawman,7-Jun," i hope and pray that you guys are correct and prices are as low as you predict. personally, i don't see it.consider this - how much did the e46 330i coupe sticker for? on paper, the  bmw  should be a dead ringer for this car in performance - and it's even built on a version of the same platform. honda ing to nada, edmunds, and k toyota , $25,000 doesn't even buy a used 2003 330i coupe! why on earth would bmw sell this much performance for the price of a  volkswagen   volkswagen ? "
qbrozen,7-Jun, how much did the e46 330i coupe sticker for?i don't see why this matters. its a smaller car. that's like pricing a mazd audi s based on a mazd audi  4-banger just because they have the same powertrain. 
kyfdx,7-Jun," actually, i think you can buy the mazd audi  for less than the mazd audi  s.. :surprise: "

blueguydotcom,7-Jun," fed, the world has changed. an e46 coupe was outclassed power wise by 2005. and nada is on crack; their numbers are always wrong.the 1 series will compete with the  volkswagen  gli and  volkswagen  for buyers. the other close competitor will be the  audi . those start at 24k. it's fighting in a different division than the 3 series. the 3 series battles the is, g and  audi . the 1 will duke it out for the high end economy performance  car  ( subaru ,  volkswagen ,  mazda peed3) and top out at the mid end of the entry-lux world (probably max at about 40-41k).

blueguydotcom,7-Jun, easily. they have deals and rebates that make the 6 a 16-17k car with the 2.3 while the mazd audi  with the 2.3 doesn't get the fat rebates.

blueguydotcom,7-Jun," kyfdx, i agree about typically equipped. in fact you might be low. as an automatic, zsp and prem add about 5k to the price. i'd figure 31k for the average msrp of the 128 and 37k msrp or so for the 135. "

dan12,7-Jul," i just read some posts that aluminum trim gets really hot in the summer. now that i think about it, that makes a lot of sense. did i make a m toyota ake ordering my car with black interior and aluminum trim? should i have gone with wood instead (and maybe gray interior)? the wife hates the wood, but i'd rather not fry in the summer. "
qbrozen,7-Jul," in my experience, yes it does. "
pv2,7-Jul, i think a bigger factor in heat is the black interior; not the aluminum trim. my prior car was a 2003 cl-s with black interior and there's a noticeable improvement with the lighter interior on my 2007 tl-s. no noticeable heat on the carbon fiber or silver interior trim. you might want to try a front window shade if it's parked in the sun. 
qbrozen,7-Jul," no noticeable heat on the carbon fiber or silver interior trim.i believe carbon fiber is not known for retaining heat, however, and is the silver trim you speak of aluminum or painted plastic? the only car i really had a problem in was my 350z. the aluminum shift knob was barely usable on a real hot day if the sun had been beating on it.you are right, of course, that a sunshade can help. but the aluminum will not absorb any less of the sun's rays in a light-colored interior. "
texases,7-Jul," like you say, most 'aluminum' trim is painted/plated/whatever plastic, so no difference there, but a solid metal gear shift knob will fry you (had one many years ago). you could take an appropriately-sized foam coffee cup to slip over it to keep the sun off, but it would still heat up. the problem with metal is not that it gets hotter (everthing inside will get to about the same temperature, except for what's in the sun) but that it conducts heat so well, so it can deliver all that heat rapidly to your hand, unlike plastic. so the black interior will be the bigger factor. go to the max on legal, high-quality window tint for the side and rear windows (i wouldn't do the front) if you don't mind the reduced night vision, and get a good removeable widow shade. "
blueguydotcom,7-Jul, many  car  with aluminum trim ( bmw  and cooper s - so yes it's real aloo-mini-um) and i've never noticed them as hot to the touch. 
tayl0rd,7-Jul," real aluminum doesn't retain heat, it repels it. [ok. repel was the wrong choice of words.] that's why aluminum is used as heat shields on  car , etc. i have a car that has real aluminum trim and it [the trim] is never hot to the touch. it maintains a relatively constant temperature in hot or cold. with direct contact, heat will pass right through aluminum; with indirect contact, it just bounces off.i usually will pull aluminum foil straight out of a hot oven with my bare hands because it doesn't hold the heat of the oven. as long as you don't grab it where the hot food or cooking pan is, you're fine. "
scottm123,7-Jul," aluminum does not repel heat.the fact is that aluminum is a fantastic conductor of heat.what this means is that if aluminum is placed near a heat source, it heats very quickly and holds its heat.once the heat source is removed, it cools quickly as well.the reason you can hold the aluminum edges from the oven is because, as you open the oven door, the heat source is removed (hot air leaving oven) and replaced with cooler air.you can then hold the edges because the aluminum has cooled in that area.if aluminum repelled heat, aluminum oven bags would not work.aluminum trim in a car can and will become very warm to the touch if the source of heat is constant, like a very hot interior, caused by the sun.once the interior cools, the aluminum should cool as well, as long as the material behind the trim has cooled as well.

snakesndafield,7-Jul," i've driven them all recently; 1st the bmw - everyone claims it is unequaled in handling. who am i to argue. the steering is very weighty, possibly too much at low speeds for some. it does manage to feel very tight and extremely smooth all at once. definitely the driver's car but if you're on  honda  streets the whole time you might never notice. lousy cupholders & average interior layout, but the backseat is surprising decent. 2nd the lexus - i like it less each time. interior is superb but i find it overly c dodge ped even up front. there's no place to set your phone down. it's also slow and those are two bad strikes. i did think it had good steering weight, handles fairly well and cornered flat. to me, i liked the audi best. it's not really any bigger but it feels less c dodge ped. the little four banger is plenty quick and gets great mpg. my only problem with the audi - it's tired, looks like it's been around forever (especially the interior which is the same one from like 1999) and will be replaced by a the newer, better model inside of a year. so it's out for me. personally, i'm gonna get a used  audi . hope this helps, these things helped me make my decision.

habitat1,7-Jul," my vote is for a  bmw  rwd. unless you really need awd (i.e. anticipate driving in snow on more than an occasional basis), you are paying a lot for awd. it is heavier, less fuel efficient and, depending upon how long you keep the car, prone to more expensive maintenance and repairs down the road. the  audi  quatro is a heavy pig, imo. i've been given one a couple of times as a loaner and was anxious to give it back. for all of the drooling others do over audi's interiors, i just don't get it. i like the interior and ergonomics of my 2004 tl better. on the other end, i am spoiled by my 911, which has best   ""  kia hyundai german  ""  kia hyundai  style interior and  seat  of any car, imo.i have not driven the is250 awd but, as has been pointed out, it would likely be highest in reliabiity, but lowest in performance and driving  toyota mics, if that is of any importance. plus, the rear seat is almost worth a 2+2 designation (closer to my 911 than tl in leg room)if i were in the market for a new sedan today, the 328/335 would likely be at the top of my short l toyota .

jzalkin,7-Jul," here is my take with the following disclamer: i own a 2006 is250 rwd and had a 2004  audi  cab 1.8t before it.i chose the lexus over the bmw because of value and  toyota . i am in south fl and the roads are a grid system. only handling i get to experience is 90 degree turns so the bmw handeling factor was out. the bmw was more and did not include a power seat and leather on the car i test drove. the lexus luxury is the best quality wise and i continue to marvel at the leather (12 months and 23,000 miles later) - so smooth and soft. lexus does luxury the best and will appeal to you if you value that. the audi was great fun and i like the interior the best (the cab is better than the sedan), but quality was an issue. it maybe cliche to say about the german  car , but i always had a l toyota  of things that needed to be fixed under warr in the audi from the start and even had to get them to cover the top when it was 1,500 miles out of warr and seperated from the rear window (2 years into ownership) top would have been $6,000 to replace and i figured the car would be expensive to keep. the lexus is much better than my audi for the little things that go wrong and are annoying.the lexus back seat is tight, but i have had adults in it every so often. since it is not a weekly thing - not a major factor for me.i'll wrap it up by saying this:- lexus for luxury and peace of mind quality- bmw for logo and the privilage for paying a premium for it- audi is about to be replaced, but maybe the best priceps - my is was $32,500+ttl including premium, nav, 18  ""  kia hyundai  wheels, minor others. 75% highway and have averaged 28.4mpg since new which is why the 250 and not the 350.

jzalkin,7-Jul," let me start my rant by saying i am sorry that you have had a bad experience. now here is my but,at some point you have to voice your opinion and move on. by constantly attacking one company as all bad and saying that another (bmw in this case) is all good, just makes you look bad. your brake example is very flawed. lexus does not have a flaw, but has a product that may have a lot of break dust. my audi also had a lot of break dust. lexus owners voiced their opinion and lexus provides a solution:  ""  kia hyundai some lexus vehicles are equipped with high-friction front brake pads, specifically designed for superior braking performance and response. as a result, under certain conditions, it is possible for the customer to experience a larger volume of brake dust on the wheels.for customers who find these character toyota ics objectionable, an alternative brake pad material has been developed. as with any change made to brake pad material, brakingperformance and feeling may be altered and could possibly be reduced under certain driving conditions as a result of their usage.these alternative front brake pads have now been made available as service parts.  ""  kia hyundai i see this as a positive of a company saying that there is an alternative to the high-performance system if you want it. in your logic, lexus is bad because they provide a solution to a cosmetic item that many  car  share. others on this board has commented on bmw producing a lot of brake dust.check out the bmw forums and you will see plenty of people that are just like you saying to run from bmw. do you think they are right about bmw or are you just selective in your beliefs.i freely admit that lexus has some bad examples and both dealers and corporate have their share of issues. guess what - so does bmw, honda,   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz , et al.

shipo,7-Aug," i'm currently on a business trip in michigan and today my client (whose spouse is a gm engineer) says,   ""  kia hyundai come on; let's go drive a new cts.  ""  kia hyundai  i agreed and away we went.first off, this car is actually halfway decent looking, and while the family resemblance to the butt ugly first generation cts is definitely there, it is none-the-less sort of pleasing to look at in an angular sort of way. then i got in and was surprised to find myself sitting lower than in my old 1985 dodge daytona (i was expecting a seating position more in keeping with my 530i), and while the seating position wasn't at all un toyota able, i just thought it odd given that this car is a mid-sized sedan.the rest of the interior seems to be reasonably well thought out, and once again a vast improvement to the gen 1 car. all in all, a place where i would generally feel  toyota able for a long drive. then there was the back seat, geez can looks be deceiving or what? visually it looks large back there, however, upon entering i bashed my head on the steeply raked c pillar, and then landed with a thump down low once again. the problem here is that while the seat cushion in low, the floor isn't. i'm only 5' 8  ""  kia hyundai  and yet with my feet shoved as far forward under the front seat as i could, my thighs were rising from my hips at an angle of greater than twenty degrees.  toyota d another way, my knees were a good eight inches higher than my hips, not a good recipe for a  toyota able place to sit on a long drive.speaking of the drive, the first thing i noticed was that the steering wasn't as heavy as i would have preferred, however, for the general driving public that may not be a bad thing. personally i prefer the heavy steering of the  bmw ; however, i've heard lots of folks complain that many models from bmw and    mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz   have steering that is too heavy, so for them, the cts is probably just about perfect.found a nice country road, pulled away from a stop light and nailed it, holding full throttle through the 1-2 gear change and beyond. geez was that lame. the software that controls this thing actually backed the throttle off so that the tranny could sort of ooze into second gear. ewwww. fwiw, i mentioned to the spouse my impressions of the gear change issue and was told later in the day that a software fix was already completed and this car just needed to get patched. personally i could care less about how the automatic performs as i'd rather have a manual, but come on; our mi chevrolet ns have more positive shifting than this thing. i found myself asking out loud how a transmission like that even saw the light of day.back to the drive. if that engine has 300 horsepower, then either that car is seriously heavy, or that engine is seriously anemic. my butt-o-meter tells me that the new cts with a slushbox tranny is probably no faster than say 0-60 in the low sixes. ride wise, the car was reasonably compliant and seemed to handle well enough, that  toyota d, the tires on this thing seemed to be of the relatively narrow all-season variety, so i'm assuming that this wasn't a sport model (if there even is such a thing), and as such cannot judge it too harshly.long story short, bmw needn't be worried about this car, it seems to be targeted more at the toyota  toyota  / lexus es crowd than at the folks who buy  bmw  and  bmw   car  for their driving  toyota mics.best regards,shipo "

shipo,7-Aug," basically i meant that any late model rwd car (i.e. equipped with traction control) that isn't shod with summer ru toyota er should be more than capable of handling chicagoland roads in winter weather. the fact is that chicago and its surrounding areas are faaa-lat, and don't need the extra traction afforded by awd or even winter tires for that matter. that  toyota d, if i was to move back to chicago and have a rwd car, i'd most certainly buy a set of winter ru toyota er for it.best regards,shipo "

circlew,7-Aug," i agree you need to use care with winter driving. so, with rwd, your chances are much better with real good snow tires.in the mountains, awd would just be a notch up on capability.in chicago, some of the snow events would likely favor awd but i agree, it is not a have to have. in buffalo, all bets are off! nothing can help you in 2-3 feet of snow!regards,ow "
jkstew1,7-Aug, what kind of gas mileage do you guys/gals get in  honda  driving? what about highway driving? has anyone used 89 octane in their vehicle? 
shipo,7-Aug," using 89 octane fuel in a bmw is a fool's economy. the fact is that while the engine will run perfectly well, it will not yield as much power nor deliver as much fuel economy.  toyota d another way, while each individual tank of fuel will cost less, you'll be filling up more often and spending more money as a result.best regards,shipo "
louiswei,7-Aug," does bmw require or recommend 91 octane?if it's required then they can void the powertrain warranty if they want to play hardball. if it's only recommended then like shipo  toyota d, it's still a fool's economy. "
shipo,7-Aug," per my manual:fuel specificationsthe engine uses lead-free gasoline only.required fuel: - premium unleaded gasoline, min. 91 aki - aki = anti knock in subaru fwiw, i believe that i read elsewhere in the manual that lower grades were acceptable in an emergency, however, performance would suffer.best regards,shipo "
scottm123,7-Aug," i agree 100%.i've found this to also be true in my 06 acura  acura .i have done nothing but 91 or higher in my 07  pontiac 5.the money saved at the pump by choosing a lower grade is only put in the tank later, when you run dry quicker, since the engine runs less efficiently. "
texases,7-Aug," i understand 100% the reasons for premium = better mileage, but does anyone have the numbers that show premium = 10% better mileage? that's about the increase needed to pay for it, right? "
shipo,7-Aug," there was a study published some time ago that suggested that the reduction in mileage was more like 15%. that  toyota d, around here the difference in cost between regular and premium is more like 8%.best regards,shipo "

blueguydotcom,7-Aug," premium is about $0.20 more per gallon. 16 gallon tank, so you're paying $3.20 more per tank or maybe $160 extra per year. seems like quite a bit until you realize you're paying about over 2k a year for gas ($3.00 a gallon). it's a drop in the bucket. if premium impacts your gas mileage even a little say +1 mpg, the cost is almost negligible.15000 miles / 23 mpg * $3.20 gallon = 208715000 miles / 22 mpg * $3.00 gallon = 2045 "

shipo,7-Aug," as i'm sure you well know (i suspect your question was rhetorical), burning 87 or 89 causes detonation (pinging) when the obc sets the ignition timing at optimial settings. the detonation sensors report that fact back to the obc which then retards the ignition timing, cutting fuel economy and performance in the name of protecting the engine from damage.best regards,shipo "

shipo,7-Aug," the sad truth is that ethanol does not have the same number of calories per gallon as gasoline, and as such, your mileage will typically drop between three and eight percent when running on e10 as opposed to the same aki rated fuel with no ethanol. it doesn't matter whether you're talking about a jaguar, a bmw or an old dodge, they all suffer from in the same way due to the ethanol.best regards,shipo "

blueguydotcom,7-Sep," professional journal toyota s make their money and enjoy a fun lifestyle  chevrolet ly because they bend over for car companies. in the end, they moderate their opinions so they get invited to (and flown to) the next press junket in malta or hawaii or geneva. i don't believe it when they say that a bmw is good or a caddy is fun because their opinion is untrustworthy. the only opinion that should count when buying a car: your own. nobody from edmunds is going to buy the car for you, so while karl bauer may like the cts, unless he's paying for my car, i'd don't give a hoot how he views the cts because he has a vested interest in not offending caddy.

shipo,7-Sep," unfortunately this particular discussion has, for years, exhibited the least amount of decorum of any that i frequent (i've even boycotted it for months on end as a result). some folks are determined to convince the world that gm makes the best ellps in the world, other folks are just as determined that d toyota inction should fall to lexus or infiniti or audi or    mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  . needless to say, there are also many who hold with bmw.the above in and of itself isn't the problem. if you ever decide to take the time to review all ten thousand posts you'll see a common theme.1) a new car (or new generation of an ex toyota ing model) is announced and often heralded (by the manufacturer, the press and/or the members of the townhall) as being the ultimate bmw killer (an attribute ascribed in turn to the two generations each of the infiniti g, the lexus is and of course the cadillac cts).2) the bmw folks say   ""  kia hyundai uhhh, sorry, try again.  ""  kia hyundai 3) things degrade from there.my personal belief is that if folks would simply lose their personal biases (who me? biased?) and discuss the attributes of the various ellpss that are important to them and why they prefer one car over another (after having driven them of course), all would be well. unfortunately many folks simply look at a spec sheet and proclaim their favorites without ever even seeing the car in the flesh. not to pick on rockylee (he hasn't posted here in quite some time), but well over a year ago he was proudly proclaiming that all other makers of ellpss should in essence pack up their  car  and go home because the gen 2 cts was going to take over the world and destroy the sales of all of the other manufacturers.there is only one thing i can guarantee about rhetoric like that; it will start a cat fight that will spiral down, completely out of control. then pat will step in, shut this discussion down for a week or two to let the combatants cool down, and then it will gradually start all over again. annoying, but there it is.best regards,shipo "

sevenfeet0,7-Sep," agreed. this forum is supposed to be about things that most of us enjoy as a passtime, or certainly a drivetime. manufacturers compete for our dollars fiercely in this space and like most things concerning marketing, most of us are conditioned to preferences after a while, even decending into   ""  kia hyundai fanboyism  ""  kia hyundai . i admit it, i have preferences with certain brands over others. but i want all of them to deliver the best product possible since it's impossible for the products from one brand to satisfy everyone. after all, if everyone just bought   ""  kia hyundai your favorite brand  ""  kia hyundai , it would be a pretty boring place.regarding the two brands at issue here, cadillac has been going down this   ""  kia hyundai europeanism  ""  kia hyundai  trend for a long time before the cts, often with lousy results. i can remember the 1976 seville, the 1982 cimarron, the 1989 allante and the 1997 catera as examples. cadillac has had the unenvyable position of trying to rewrite their dna for decades now, which isn't easy. even with bob lutz at the helm, a former gm engine manager once told me that gm's corporate culture doesn't do much to reward risk...in fact, the company (and especially cadillac) got very risk averse over the last 30 years. witness the 1981 v8-6-4 engine failure, the 1982 cimarron, the 1989 allante and catera projects all made caddy very adverse making the product decisions they need to make.constrast that with bmw. the bmw we all know really got off the ground in the early '70s with the first 2002s. originally in the shadow of   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  and audi, they made their mark with great handling  sedan  and coupes that were contrary to what most american buyers were used to seeing. were all these products successful? not a chance. the 320 prog dodge  of the early '80s (especially the 320e) weren't home run hits. the 12-cylinder 850s lanquished on dealer lots and recent models were fiercely criticized for bangle styling and idrive. but the path to where bmw is now has been fairly straightforward to the point where they command many of the segments they compete in.in business, it's interesting to watch the players that do most everything right but its far more fun and educational to see the ones that were once powerful fall from grace and claw themselves back to relevance. apple computer is a classic example. cadillac is trying to do the same thing (against bigger odds in my opinion). what happens next? who knows? but the marketplace will decide.

sevenfeet0,7-Sep," hi mark,i can agree on some of your points and disagree on others. first, i do think the cts is a member of the 5 series competitor club with the exception of the non-availability of v8 power. it has just about everything else. there are a few options sometimes found in this group (lane change avoidance) that are still only available on the sts, probably to keep some product seperation while that model goes on its long march to oblivion.and regarding infiniti, ah yes, they do upset the ol' product line apple cart, don't they? the  bmw 5 is on the large size of the class, mostly in terms of length (one of the reasons i liked it...it's always been on my short l toyota ). the  pontiac 5 is supposed to be the bmw 3 series competitor, but in terms of size, it's the   ""  kia hyundai tweener car  ""  kia hyundai  that the old cts was. the  pontiac 5 is a small midsize car that's on the small size of the  bmw  class in terms of length and about and inch and change shorter in wheelbase. the width is narrower, much like the old cts. as a result, it's playing in that   ""  kia hyundai i can be a 3 series competitor and give you more room  ""  kia hyundai  role that the old cts was doing. as a result, it's simular engine power but smaller mass gives it a small advantage to the new cts but still nips the heels of the smaller bmw.given your previous posts, i know awd is a bigger priority for you up in ohio versus for me down in tennessee. and that's fine by me. the  pontiac 5 awd will probably pull a more sporting performance that the cts awd given a likely 400-500 lb weight advantage. the cts gives the driver more interior room (especially leg room) which is a bigger priority for me (top priority really).

fedlawman,7-Oct," i checked out the new cts over the weekend and i've gotta say, i'm pretty impressed. one caveat: i didn't drive a manual, so i won't talk about performance/ toyota mics right now. suffice it to say the ride/handling compromise is class appropriate, with a refined driveline that has no bad manners or noticeable deficiencies.sure, it's not the sportiest car in this segment (it's far to big and heavy for that), but i respect the fact that cadillac didn't try to beat bmw at their own (increasingly ambiguous) game.instead, cadillac has built a car that has one of the nicest, roomiest cabins in this class, and trimmed it with high quality materials and appointments. it's easily the nicest cabin i've ever seen on a gm, and a match in quality and layout to anything in the class. the stitched seams on the soft-touch dashboard covering, and the wood and metallic  hyundai s are very pleasing. i found the backseat to be quite  toyota able too, although as previously mentioned, the footwell is tight. exterior styling is definitely too contrived (subjective, i know) - too many angles and random acts of chrome for my tastes, but again, it looks modern and aggressive - even attractive - and for its part, at least it doesn't look like every other car on the road. i have to respect gm for trying something different and mostly pulling it off.personally, i think the softer, larger, and heavier  bmw  has alienated many of the driving enthusiasts interested in this segment, and it will be up to the lighter, more compact 1-series to win us back over bmw. i don't know if the cts now defines this segment - bigger and more luxurious yet still sporty, but it definitely compares favorably with the bmw and infinity on the performance-----luxury continuum. every car in this segment has slid way to the right on that scale over the past few years, so who can fault cadillac for gra toyota ing tightly onto the right end?what remains to be seen is whether gm can sell it in the volumes it deserves. i don't think the cts will fail because of its quality, styling, features, or luxury. i think the toughest battle the cts faces is still the stigma associated with the badge it wears on the hood. "
cdnpinhead,7-Oct," interesting. thanks.you could well be correct with your assessment that cadillac has squandered their once-revered status. could be worse, though -- think lincoln.either way, the cts carved a decent niche with its first version, and most appear to fall all over themselves exclaiming over how much better this one is.if cadillac can get even a few bmw/audi/infiniti/mb people to come over, there's a huge cadre of   ""  kia hyundai buy american  ""  kia hyundai  folks who'll drive it for that reason alone.looks to me like it's going to be a winner, though it does look strange & a bit gaudy (for my taste, such as it is). "
fedlawman,7-Oct," agreed.i think those of us driving enthusiasts who favor bmw's are inherently opposed to gaudiness and flash. unfortunately, i think we are in the minority.there are many others that want a car that is sporty and luxurious, yet also serves as a fashion statement (style, status, etc.). i've seen enough bmw's wearing 19  ""  kia hyundai  chrome wheels to know that the cts will be a big success.

sevenfeet0,7-Oct," i think the reasonings behind bmw doing the 1 series are pretty simple, and i doubt it came as backlash from 3 series owners (that car still has crazy sales numbers). the fact is that the bmw 3 series had grown in size and purpose from its 2002tii roots and that there was a potential model that could be inserted there now. that combined with the fact that the 3 series is getting so expensive that it is pricing itself out of the hands of its youngest customers makes the business case.

"
shov8,7-Nov," just a minor point on your post. you state you can get the  pontiac 5 configured in a way you don't like (the navigation system), vs. the built-to-order ed  bmw . the big caveat here that is not addressed is the   ""  kia hyundai ed  ""  kia hyundai  part. with ed (european delivery) you have to physically travel to munich and pick up the car. ed does include shipping back to the usa and delivery to your dealer (a total of 8-10 weeks later,  honda ing to the web site). but the cost of flying to munich and back, plus at least one night (probably two) in a hotel, isn't included. a sample trip in february 2008 (because you need to allow three months to build the bmw  honda ing to bmw.com) from san diego, ca to munich runs around $2000 on expedia. then there is a night or two in a hotel, plus misc expenses. i'm just getting a ball-park figure, but lets say $2500 minimum for the trip. so that +$1500 cost for the  bmw  just went up to +$4000 total. true, you do get to go to munich  so that is a bonus. of course, you need to take time off from work, etc., so maybe that cancels that out. still, we are trying to compare cost, so i think the trip cost should be added in. since you took delivery of a 330i via ed maybe you could share the expenses involved with that so we could make an accurate  bmw  via ed vs  pontiac 5 cost comparison. thanks,  kc "
blueguydotcom,7-Nov,"  with ed (european delivery) you have to physically travel to munich and pick up the car.that's what ed is. shrug. i didn't say otherwise as i clearly mentioned you have to get the car in munich. so that +$1500 cost for the  bmw  just went up to +$4000 total. true, you do get to go to munich so that is a bonus. of course, you need to take time off from work, etc., so maybe that cancels that out. still, we are trying to compare cost, so i think the trip cost should be added in.why? it's called a vacation. i'd be doing the flight and trip anyway so it's not relevant to the cost, imho. hell, we just spent two weeks in thailand and had i bought some major ticket item at that moment i wouldn't consider the flight as a cost as i'd be there on vacation anyway. should i opt for another bmw, i'm fairly sure we'll make a vacation of it as we have friends living in paris and london. in fact just last night we began talking about a trip to france in late 08 or 09.  since you took delivery of a 330i via ed maybe you could share the expenses involved with that so we could make an accurate  bmw  via ed vs  pontiac 5 cost comparison. thanks,flight = $900 (of course i've got about 200k in frequent flyer miles now so it'd be free. additionally, lufthansa has a two-for-one bmw special) *two nights at munich marriott - $100 (or use starwood points for free hotel stays)train to bmw delivery center = $8 euros (about $11 us)ride to marriott from redelivery center - $35 uslufthansa airport  honda  from munich marriott to muc - $14 usfood - ~$100 us (actually far less as food is cheap in germany)*this was a vacation so i just factored in my germany costs. in actuality i drove south through germany, austria and switzerland into italy and then swung west through the south of france. i eventually drove through france and back into switzerland, austria and germany. i noted my germany costs only as over the entire trip i spent far more but that included nights on the french riviera and seaside hotels. fwiw, if infiniti or some other manu had a jd delivery prog dodge  (and  car  worth driving) i'd take another vacation to japan. "
shov8,7-Nov," looks like about $1200 extra from your l toyota  of expenses. i think, if it were not for the vacation part, your airfare would be more expensive. not sure if the airlines like a saturday night stay like they do domestically, but when i looked prices up on a tues to thurs trip it was around $2000 for airfare. i don't think many people will be in your situation, that is, having the time/money to take a vacation and pick up a car. plus the waiting time to have the car built (three months), then shipped back (8-10 weeks, or more), is a limiting factor for a lot of people. you're talking almost 6 months before you actually get your car in the garage.  i guess my point is, your original post stated that given the ed pricing the  bmw  wins the comparison, but not everyone can do the ed thing. i'm not saying that getting a  bmw  for <$40k even with the european trip is a bad thing, far from it, it's just that only a few probably do the ed experience (i wonder how many do it?) given the time/cost factors and therefore ed pricing shouldn't be used as a factor in a car comparison. thanks,  kc "
blueguydotcom,7-Nov," i understand your point of view, but can't really agree with it. i'd contend a majority of people buying in the entry-lux market fits a few criteria:1. they already have a car.2. they spend a bit of time looking for a car3. they have the option of waiting for an ordered car - but many choose not to wait. 4. most are in fairly  toyota able jobs that have pto and most take some kind of vacation.bmw's roundel mag had an article on ed. the numbers are growing yearly and have been for decades. still it makes up a small fraction but it's significant enough that audi kicked in their prog dodge  this year and it's a bit more generous with knick-knacky silly things like   ""  kia hyundai free hotel  ""  kia hyundai  stays and such.as for considering it for pricing: most people have the choice. priorities i guess.

spiritinthesky,7-Nov," i happen to own a 2003  bmw  with 45k miles. and, coincidentally, before i bought the  bmw , i had been all set to purchase a 545i sport 6-speed. the party that had the  bmw  on order defaulted, dealer called me and i came in with a check for full msrp that afternoon. the  bmw  certainly depreciates, but not proportionally as much as the standard v8  bmw . at least not in my (pittsburgh) area. i paid $75,800 for mine, and have been offered $38,000 in cash (not trade) by the dealer. the 545i had an msrp of $62,000 and would probably be worth around $26,000 today (rough  toyota te by my dealer). the big difference is that the  bmw  has a dedicated enthusiast following. everyone knows what it is. the 545i/550i 6-speeds are very nice  car , but less than 10% of v8 buyers opt for the 6 speed. the vast majority are automatics and sold to an affluent, but not necessarily   ""  kia hyundai driving enthusiast  ""  kia hyundai  demographic. that definitely makes resale a bit more of a challenge and my dealer indicated he would only take a 545/550 of any kind on a trade (would not buy for cash). i didn't buy the  bmw  with resale value being a high consideration. but i'm pretty sure that if i looked at the numbers, i'd get most of the additional $15k i spent on the  bmw  over the 545i back, if i decided to part with it tomorrow. but i have no interest in doing that. it still drives like the day i bought it and there really is nothing sweeter in a sedan than that hand built m engine effortlessly running up to redline or that sport suspension handling the curves almost as well as my 911 turbo. p.s. i bought in may 2003, making it exactly 4 1/2 years old. as in precisely.

circlew,7-Dec," here is some news. i could not tell if some of the models will be applicable and perhaps some of the future names could be part of the ellps category. it just goes to show the continued muddied direction that boggles the mind!if you liked alphabet soup as a kid, make an appointment at your cadillac dealer for three to five years from now. that's because gm has recently trademarked several new nameplates for cadillac, and so far we're worried and a bit confused.at present, these names are trademarked in europe and canada. however, companies often reg toyota er their trademarks in foreign markets first, and later in the united states.this potential new naming system is undoubtedly complicated, but we will try and lay it out in the simplest way possible. so far, gm has trademarked: * dt7 * ct6 * ct5 * bt3 * at1 * dtx * ctx * btxwe suspect the numbers in each name signifies each vehicle's overall size.the   ""  kia hyundai dt7  ""  kia hyundai  might be the eventual dts replacement, for example. this large, luxury sedan may end up riding on the zeta chassis in a few years time.the ct6 and ct5 would be some kind of v honda nts of the car we currently know as the cts. one possibility is the numbers indicate two possible wheelbase lengths. on the other hand, we can't rule out the   ""  kia hyundai 5  ""  kia hyundai  and   ""  kia hyundai 6  ""  kia hyundai  being the current cts sedan and forthcoming cts coupe.the bt3 could represent the next-generation bls. this vehicle would probably be on the epsilon ii chassis, however, with gm's plans on the new alpha chassis being unclear, there is always a possibility bt3 could be an alpha car.the at1 is still a bit of a mystery. that  toyota d, it's a safe bet that this would be a small car that is definitely based on the alpha chassis gm is currently developing. could it be a competitor to the bmw 1-series?the   ""  kia hyundai x  ""  kia hyundai   car  will more than likely denote crossover or wagon vehicles. however we'd also leave open the option that the   ""  kia hyundai x  ""  kia hyundai  indicates all-wheel-drive models.if the crossover assumption is true, the dtx is probably the vehicle currently known as the brx. the ctx could be the forthcoming cts wagon, and the btx remains a mystery.of course, the all-wheel-drive option is also a strong possibility. the ctx could be an awd ct6 or ct5, while the dtx would be an awd dt7, and so on.obviously there is one glaring part of cadillac's lineup not mentioned here &#151; the  cadillac s. some might suggest that the   ""  kia hyundai x  ""  kia hyundai  vehicles we just talked about are in fact the trucks. however, given what our sources say, we don't think that's the case.that leaves a few options. one being that gm just hasn't gotten around to coming up with new names. another being that the true cadillac trucks will not be part of this new scheme and continue on with regular names. with the marketing power the  cadillac  name  toyota es, we think the latter is more likely. :confuse: regards,ow "

blueguydotcom,8-Jan," the brand didn't make lexus...the ls400 did. the car. the brand was meaningless. 20 years ago everybody scoffed at the notion of the japanese making a rwd v8 sedan that could compete with bmw and mb. the lexus dealerships had nothing to do with sales; the product and the price sold the lexus ls400 and made lexus into what it is today (highly overpriced). euro snobs laughed at the japanese competitors and  toyota d people wanted an established brand.  people wanted a luxury nameplate. people bought the badge. and that's somewhat true. of course, lexus also offered a 35k v8 luxury sedan that undercut the euro competition by well over 10k. suddenly luxury  sedan  were well within reach for people who didn't want to fork over dough for a jag,    mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz   or bimmer.the  hyundai  will appeal to the same folks and i really seeing it hitting infiniti, lexus and acura the hardest (most likely acura and infiniti will take it hard). why spend 50k on an m45 or 5 series when you can get a  hyundai  for 40k and it's decked out the same way?

blueguydotcom,8-Mar," we've got an  audi  - 2006 with dsg. in terms of room it's far, far bigger inside than the lexus. we easily take 4 adults in an  audi . we use it to make trips to costco, storage, etc. shockingly our 2006 has held its value really well. we paid 22k for it in march 2007 and with 27k miles it's still worth at least 21k. the engine's powerful, yet the car gets great gas mileage and the dsg is still fun to play with. it handles poorly but then again so does the lexus. on the downside, audi service is horrible. i had no idea how good i had it with bmw until i took our audi in for the   ""  kia hyundai free  ""  kia hyundai  maintenance. one of the passenger door lock switches bl toyota ered and the ru toyota er came off it. the scumbags at audi of america  toyota d it was a trim and normal wear piece so the warranty did not apply. they  toyota d repair of the switch would be $300. seriously, how awful is audi? my wife swore up and down, telling me she loves the car but we will never buy an audi again. a 2 year old car with a bl toyota ered door switch and it's not covered by the warranty? that's obscene - especially when it's obviously a defect, not a result of wear or tear.  lexus typically builds bulletproof  car  and i'm betting the is follows suit. service is pricey but rarely needed.

blueguydotcom,8-Mar," cooper's been fantastic. 1 year and no real  problem  (dsc would freak once in awhile when i was at stoplights but a software reflash cured that). otherwise it's just a super fun car. i'm averaging 30 mpg, it's got a shocking amount of useful space, it's perfect for the  honda , great on long drives and just a joy to drive. i keep checking the value and the car's been a rock too - which was my goal when i bought it. i have an appointment with my bmw dealer to try the 1 when it comes in. i've seen it in person and love the pudgy, aggressive, tall look of the car. my wife's sure we can fit a baby in the back easily but i'm not sold. still, i'll take one for a spin (ideally a 128 as i don't see the value in the 135 yet). "
blueguydotcom,8-Mar," consider the  volkswagen  too. it's not as stylish or as upscale feeling as the  audi  but it's got a taller cabin that makes entry/exit easier. downside, it has a smaller trunk and slightly cheaper feel. a 2007 4 door  volkswagen  will be a bit cheaper to about the same price as a 2006  audi . it's a better handling car but the soundproofing isn't quite as good.

kyfdx,8-Mar," no... that was my first thought: someone left the dang seat all the way up.. so, i backed out, and checked... it was all the way back.. it was just like trying to get in my own car, when my wife leaves the seat pulled up.. i can't figure out how i took a 30-minute test drive, and drooled over it for another hour, without realizing that before.... although, my beer consumption is way up.. maybe, that is having an effect on my midriff... :surprise: i love the  acura , as well...

activex111,8-Mar," thanks for all replies. on another forum in this site, a lot of  audi  owners complained about severe  problem  with dsg transmission. almost all talk about exact same problem that it suddenly losses power, or keeps shifting gears. that is kinda scary, particularly after reading the dealer experiences here. i wonder if this isa common problem or just few owners have faced it "
activex111,8-Mar, i really like the base tl. but my colleague gets like 15 mpg in stop and go traffic of la. i drive almost 60 miles roundtrip everyday. the mileage is a bummer otherwise i think that the interior and sound of tl is one of the best in that class.

plekto,8-Mar," just be aware of how large the turning radius is on the  acura . it's almost 40 ft!an is250 is 33.4ft. it's an astounding difference, especially when you are parking. the  acura  feels like you are parking a buick. "
shipo,8-Mar," it is an engineering trick to allow for a good turning radius on fwd  car . while there are exceptions to every rule, it is generally easier to design a rwd car with a tight turning radius than a fwd or awd car.best regards,shipo "
plekto,8-Mar," the  toyota  is 35.6ft, or about 4 feet smaller.a buick  buick  is 40.4ft., versus the  acura  at 40.0. something's just off with the engineering on it. "
cdnpinhead,8-Mar," as shipo says, generally rwd  car  enjoy tighter turning circles. however, my source (can't remember what it was at this point) says the  acura  turning circle is 38.1 feet, the same as my rwd lincoln ls. the old (two years ago) bmw330 is all of two feet less, at 36.1. i show the fwd  audi  at 35.1, the best of all the  car  i've been considering, most of which are rwd. otoh, my comparison  hyundai  (yes, my screen name is apropos) shows the is250 at 35.5 feet, not the ~33.5 foot number you cite.either way, cv joints take a real beating in fwd  car  at the extremes of steering-wheel travel, so there is probably a longevity benefit to not allowing them to go as far as they might otherwise. god knows,  honda  (& acuras) last forever.

scottm123,8-Mar," can i chime in? :blush: my short l toyota  was the is250, the acura tl and the  pontiac 5x.i drove the is250 and although fit and finish was outstanding, the size was a deal breaker for me, since i had a 4 yr old daughter who had to be comfy in the back. the lack of power had me worried about the novelty wearing off as well.that brought me to the tl and the  pontiac 5x.i had to really weigh the pros and cons to come to a decision. honestly, both are awesome  car  and you can't go wrong with either one.for me, the g just gave me a feeling that the tl could not. the dealer, where i bought my 06  acura , gave me a tl loaner on 7 separate days... one being a type-s as well.as much as i enjoyed them (especially the mpg), i got bored with them.the g (for me) is way more fun to drive. it has more power and i felt more in control of the g as well. it offers more feedback (in a good way)i now have awd when i need it (it's fantastic in the snow!) and rwd performance at any other time.also, i found that my right knee hits the center console in the tl and my left arm, which i like to rest on the window edge, was un toyota able. the window edge was too high and the arm rest was too low.the   ""  kia hyundai studio on wheels  ""  kia hyundai  stereo in the g is more enjoyable and i also feel that the fit/finish/ level of luxury in the g is higher than that of the tl. i love the look of the real rosewood trim in my car and how it contrasts with the black interior.i also have absolutely no rattles after 14,000 miles and one year of driving.again, this is all personal preference.i liked both  car , but the g just did it better for me.

louiswei,8-Mar," yes, the is250's rear seat is real  tight, to have adults sitting in the back on any trips over an hour would be a pretty terrible idea. however, since my rear seat is normally unoccupied about 99.9% of the time that's really not an issue for me.my suggestion is that make sure you think about this thoroughly, if the tight rear seat bugs you then just turn around and look for something else.

(don't even gt me started on the  audi  in base trim) add that stuff in ad it jumps to $33k almost instantly. car direct price: $28,408 -  mazda  gt/+ rear spoiler. if you want more bling, you have to start adding chrome and after-market accessories.$5k out the door cheaper buys a lot of gas.(5pmg difference is roughly 7100 gallons to make up at 3.50 a gallon)it's also the same reason a  toyota  is a no-win situation versus a  honda . 5mpg difference for thousands more in initial price is going to take you well over a decade to recover. maybe two.

kdshapiro,8-Mar," there is a general tendency for the x28i to be overrated, i'm not defending the x2.8 but clearly this is your humble opinion. i agree specificially with regards to you, you should pay more for more horsepower. everybody doesn't think like that and bmw recognizes this. "
shipo,8-Mar," i think that you are entirely too caught up in straight line acceleration, and if that's your only yardstick, go buy a  subaru  and be done with it. there are plenty of people who would consider the x28i over the x35i, and for many reason, me included. when i leased my 2002 530i i made the conscious decision not to get a 540i (or an  bmw  for that matter). why? because the 530i was plenty fast enough for my needs, wants and desires. i don't constantly need to prove my manhood by blowing every slammed honda away at every light, i buy the car for me. period, full stop, the end.some time in the next year i'll be buying a new car, and the top five contenders are as follows:1) audi 2.0t 6-speed s-line (via european delivery)2) 2001-2003 bmw 530i sedan 5-speed sport package3) bmw  bmw  coupe 6-speed sport package (via european delivery)4) bmw  bmw  sedan 6-speed sport package (via european delivery)2) 2001-2002 bmw 540i sedan 6-speed sport packagenotice that every one of those  car  can be had with a bigger/badder/faster (and thirstier) engine. fwiw, the only reason why the 540i is on the l toyota  is that i really like e39s with a stick shift and lots of other goodies, goodies that are often hard to find in the 530i but yet seem to be on virtually every 540i from that vintage.best regards,shipo "
sjaieve,8-Mar," i was not only looking at straight line acceleration, if you read my posts i also considered options available on these 2  car  and the lex comes on top.  subaru  is not my piece of cake, in fact i was in a friends 400+ hp pontiac  pontiac  and that car is certainly not my piece of cake either, although its way faster than a  bmw . given a choice btwn the  pontiac  and the  bmw , i would take the  bmw  even if its more expensive.i agree speed is not everyone's concern, like i  toyota d, i want everything i can get for my money, that includes power, toys, luxury. i only consider  car  within the ellps though, thats what i drive "
jmess,8-Mar," i have been driving a c6 for 3 years and i hear you about speed. this car is wicked fast and i almost get tired of having to constantly monitor my speed. i tend to find  car  that i can follow at a respectful d toyota ance just so i will keep the speed down. with the traffic flows where i live there are very few chances to really feel the speed and i have done the club racing game already. i am currently looking at moving to a wagon, possibly a  bmw . it sucks getting old and becoming more rational.

riorebel,8-Mar," actually, i admitted that my main reason for buying a tl-s over a  pontiac 5 was my wife's taste. that doesn't sound very fanboish to me. that being  toyota d, i am very happy with my choice, and i don't regret it in the least. "

sjaieve,8-Mar," agreed 100%.  bmw  is still a much better car imo than the  pontiac  irrespective of the hp difference. like i  toyota d, i have respect for the  bmw , i might not buy it but thats besides the point. "
chirocat,8-Mar," you should also ask yourself how you are going to use the car. if you are going to be using it on the track vs a daily driver. then ask how you drive, some of these  car  have very little torque and have to be revved to get average acceleration, as i get older i find it more irritating. last december i narrowed the choice down to a tl-s, a  pontiac 5, a cts-v and a few others. i went with the tl-s and it's pretty much the perfect daily driver. sure i notice the torque steer and it may only do the 1/4 mile in 14.1, but i can't really use all of that on a daily basis anyway. the other stuff, it's amazing honda reliability, compliant ride, and upscale interior make daily driving pleasant. the slick 6 speed manual is a joy to row and the engine has enough torque that i can dust 95% of the  car  without even engaging the v-tec. the best part is that despite a heavy foot in the  honda  part of my commute and a median speed of 80 mph on the freeway, i still average 23 mpg. i have just over 3k miles so the mileage might even get better. it's hard to beat this combo. if it was rwd it would be even better. next year they are talking sh-awd but i doubt it will have a manual box, so my next car will probably be a 335 or similar.

lockgiants,8-Mar," personally i think that, although they are in the same entry level class, both the g and tl serve slightly differenet markets, and the choice should really depend on what you want. i bought a tl for a simple reason: value and location. i didnt want a rear wheel drive car since im in chicago, and a fully loaded  pontiac 5 w/ awd would have cost me 36k. and to those who argue the opinions here are biast, i actually liked the g better, but i simply could not say no to a fully loaded tl for 31.5k (with 2k back). if youre someone who is willing to pay extra for the power, the g or the is350 are better options. but the tl is a much quieter ride, and has much more bang for the buck. not to mention the fuel economy is better, especially with gas at record highs. but like most say, you cant really go wrong with either. "
pat,8-Mar, how 'bout we back to these  car  now? 
chirocat,8-Mar," i really liked the  pontiac 5, the studio on wheels is a nice concept and the compact flash slot was a better idea than an ipod jack imho. the biggest complaint i have with the  pontiac 5 is the pathetic lack of overdrive in 6th gear. my previous car was a 98  nissan  and it was tiring having the engine at 3300 rpm for my entire freeway commute. the  pontiac 5 gearing was almost the same, whereas the tl-s is much more relaxed on the freeway, cruising well under 3000 rpm (2750). a few milder negatives with the g was the lack of smoothness in the clutch and some vibration in the shifter, and the insurance was also a good chunk more, at least with my company(interestingly, the r32 was the most expensive). i added all these together with a lack of enthusiasm for a good deal and the tl-s got the nod. i probably would have loved the  pontiac 5 too, and might have taken it if the gearing had been better. either way, you can't go wrong, they are all awesome  car . :shades: "

pat,8-Mar, this started out in one of the tl discussions. i moved the thread here.  
adamr001,8-Mar," i test drove a lot of  car  before i chose the  pontiac 5. the tl was one of them. my main complaint about the tl was / is fwd. the car has all the usual fwd  problem  and didn't handle being   ""  kia hyundai upset  ""  kia hyundai  in mid-corner nearly as well as the rwd  car  i tested (nor as well as some of the other fwds (9-3) either). i liked the car, i liked the price, but i couldn't get past the fwd and handling.if you test drive a  pontiac 5, make sure and test drive one with 4-wheel active steering. seriously. the difference between a sport and 4was-sport still  honda s me. some of the other  car  i test-drove were:lexus is350 : only complaints, rear  seat  slightly too small, no manual transmission option, otherwise this was the   ""  kia hyundai best  ""  kia hyundai  car i drove from an overall perspective.bmw bmw  : excellent car, but it felt a bit soulless. it didn't leave me just drooling and wanting to get back in and drive. i can't really explain it better than that. i just didn't wow me.bmw bmw  : not in the same ballpark as the other  car  i drove. lacks the power.saab 9-3 aero : fwd again, but otherwise this was a fun car and was 3rd in my ranking.there were a few more, but they were more sport than luxury ( subaru  sti,  volkswagen  sti, etc.)ultimately, it's all about what you want.i wanted (in order of importance)4 doorssportluxury interior + toysmanual transmissionthus i chose the  pontiac 5.

jeffmo2334,8-Mar," i thought i'd chime in here, since my main decision was between the tl and  pontiac 5.i have been a honda guy, so at first was not even considering the  pontiac 5, and so was looking at the tl, especially considering the great deals that were possible considering the desire to clear out the 08's before the 09's came in. a friend recommended i look at the  pontiac 5's, so at first i just went to the dealership and looked at them (on a sunday so i couldn't test drive one), and i thought the looks and interior were very impressive looking, and so decided i would consider it.i test drove the tl (not type s) and, while it was solid, i was not swept away. i was a bit disappointed with the low-end power and responsiveness. i then test drove the  pontiac 5 and was blown away with how the engine performed. very responsive, and i like the way the transmission adapts to the driver's driving style.i thought i'd end up paying a lot more for the  pontiac 5 given the incentives offered on the tl's, but actually found that the  pontiac 5 incentives were even better, assuming you are financing a large % of the total cost of the car. the 2.9% financing for up to 63 months (incentive until 3/31) saves me about $2000 vs. the 5.24% rate i could get from my credit union, plus this month they have added an additional $500 cash rebate, for a total   ""  kia hyundai incentive saving  ""  kia hyundai  of about $2500, greater than the tl incentive. also, i was able to get a deal for slightly below invoice even before the incentives, so ended up with the exact car i wanted ( dodge  with premium, no nav, wood trim, garnet ember with charcoal interior) for $32,150 or so, and considering the financing deal, over the length of the payments the cost is the same as buying a car at $30,200 and getting the 5.24% rate. this is not far from what i could get on a tl, even with the model changing, and this way i get a car that is a new body design (as of 07) and is the car i like better.anyway, i think both  car  are great, but i prefer the  pontiac 5. my main issue was the engine's performance and exterior styling.jeff  "
shipo,8-Mar," that won't help those of us who are manual transmission bigots. best regards,shipo "
shipo,8-Mar," you might want to consider fuel economy given the price of fuel these days. the tl is well known for delivering decent fuel economy in spite of its powerful motor; the  pontiac 5 not so much.best regards,shipo "

jeffmo2334,8-Mar," good point on the fuel economy. the  pontiac 5 seems to average 17-19mpg in mixed driving, while the tl is in the low 20's. i think the 5-speed automatic has something to do with that, since even on the highway it revs at a pretty high rpm.jeff "

adamr001,8-Mar," well my observations are that even with the  infiniti  gas milage is determined by how often you keep your foot on the accellerator. if you can avoid on/off your milage will increase. it doesn't seem to matter (again, anecdotal evidence) if i accellerate hard or soft. it's the simple matter of accellerating that consumes the fuel. if i maintain speed / cruise milage climbs immediately. "
shipo,8-Mar," to be sure, for any given car, if you keep your foot out of it, it will deliver better fuel economy, however, some  car  are still more adept at getting better mileage than others, and in this class of  car , the  pontiac 5 seems to cons toyota ently deliver the worst fuel economy.best regards,shipo "
adamr001,8-Mar," oh, i didn't say that it didn't. the  pontiac 5 is more sports car than performance luxury sedan.it's just that i can make my  pontiac 5 hit 20mpg in mixed driving or i can make it hit 17mpg. all by how i keep my foot on / off the pedal. on the highway, under cruise, i have no  problem  hitting 27mpg. without cruise i run about 23mpg. to be sure, the  pontiac 5 isn't a fuel efficient vehicle. "
jeffmo2334,8-Mar," i think that all who look into this issue will unanimously agree that the  pontiac 5 tends to get worse gas mileage than the tl -- by 2-3 mpg or so. one must weigh this into the decision they are making -- if an individual likes the  pontiac 5 better, they need to ask themselves whether they like it   ""  kia hyundai enough better  ""  kia hyundai  to pay a little more for gas.i drive about 800 miles/month, so for me the difference of 2-3 mpg means about an extra 4.5-6 gallons of gas a month, which at current prices here in houston ($3.20/gal for 93 octane), is about $14 to $19 a month. for me, i liked the  pontiac 5 at least that much more than the tl, so i don't mind paying the extra gas $$. even if gas goes up to $4/gallon, the difference will be $20-$24 per month, and i am still ok with that difference. if all else was equal and i liked the tl just as much as the  pontiac 5, then i would clearly have chosen it for the better gas mileage.mileage is definitely a factor to consider, and each individual has to weight each factor by their own relative utilities.jeff "
shipo,8-Mar," yeah, well i guess my comments were colored by the fact that i often drive 800 in a single week (with 500 being typical). there is no doubt that if the montly mileage isn't huge, even gas for a hummer won't be significant. ;-)best regards,shipo "

adamr001,8-Mar," doubtful, for me at least. diesel pumps are harder and harder to find in the  honda . easy to find in small towns / on the highway, but hard in-town. when i had a cummins i routinely had to travel 15-30 minutes out of my way to get fuel. not keen on doing that again. "
shipo,8-Mar," i'd buy a bmw or audi diesel in a heartbeat. i've driven them in europe and and entirely impressed, especially in their abilities to accelerate from say 20 mph to speeds of well over 100 mph. forget the issue of fuel availability, if diesel  car  start becoming popular (and i predict that they will), gasoline stations will increasingly start offering diesel as well. case in point, of the three closest gas stations to our house, none of them  toyota ed diesel when we moved here in 2002, now they all do. why? well in our area, diesel trucks pickups and suvs are quite popular as are  volkswagen  tdis and    mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz   e320 diesels.best regards.,shipo "

blueguydotcom,8-Mar," not shipo but i must say the  bmw  is very attractive to me. well, all diesels are. gas here is $4 a gallon for premium. diesel is about 20 cents more a gallon and the same station is a quarter of a mile from my house. if i can get 30 mpg with a diesel  bmw  v. 22 mpg with a 335, it's an easy call.$2100 a year for diesel and $2700 for premium. the diesel may cost more upfront but for me the idea of stopping less often is also really attractive. as prices go up, the savings will increase too. so if i'm looking at $5 a gallon in 2010 (seems reasonable to assume), my savings increase by hundreds.

plekto,8-Mar," i've come to the conclusion that the best car for the op is actually none of the above.he wants something affordable and sporty and luxury, that's also reliable and gets good gas mileage. unfortunately, they stopped making this car 2-3 years ago, but that's fine, because used like-new examples run about $20k.get a   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  c230k sedan with manual. this is the *4 door* sedan with the 1.8 supercharged engine in it. it was the exact same model that they sell in europe(slightly larger engine) and is actually fairly reliable.   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  makes two types of  car .  car  and taxis/rentals. the way you can tel the difference is if it comes with stick-shift, since 90% of germans get a license that allows them to drive manuals. if you are one of the 10% that gets an automatic-only license, you are literally laughed at and considered to be a child driver.  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  puts no effort into their fleet sales and models, and especially their automatic transmissions. just enough to get by and no more(s class aside of course). this is why an e class, well, *is* a taxi in 90% of the world. and it's why their suvs suck. they are made for basically u.s. markets and taxis.(see a pattern? heh)in europe, it's all about the a, b, and c class. manuals are the norm and diesels are better. the closer   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  you buy to this sort of vehicle, the better it will drive and last.in europe, it's called the c200 kompressor and is a great car. unfortunately, you have to go back to the previous generation in the u.s. to get that engine.of course, the best   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  is this:c 220 cdi 4-cylinder 190 hp 460 nmif we got this over here, it would obliterate the entry-level segment. 460nm is an outrageous amount of torque, and 190hp is equal to the is250. all while getting 30+ mpg.http://autocar-show.blogspot.com/2007/06/first-drive-experience-  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz -c220.ht- mlbummer we can't get it here...****now, if you're looking for automatic(sigh), get couple of year old is300. this car has the is250's looks and feel, yet is lighter and lots more powerful, plus it has a nice i-6 engine as well. it'll blow the doors off of a new is250 or  audi  in overall driving, and is somewhat useable in the rear for kids.note - while the is300 was good, it honestly reminded me exactly of the volvo 850, but with rwd instead of fwd. it had a very   ""  kia hyundai european  ""  kia hyundai  feel to it. something abot the balance and suspension and size and all the rest - it felt better than the base 3 series.the lexus messed up. they made a compromise version that's honestly not any better than the stuff gm puts out, and they put a mega-speed transmission and a v6 in the is350 in a quest for power, when all it did as turn it into a muscle car.remember, the original luxury performance sedan was... a bmw 2002. light,  chevrolet , and well rounded are musts. bloat, muscle-car power, and in search for a purpose... that's most modern  car .or you can get a classic.  there's no shame in driving a classic car.

fedlawman,8-Mar," i just filled up with premium tonight and paid $3.69/gal23 mpg 36,000 miles @$3.69/gal = 1565 gallons = $5775.of course, i'm not sure why, but i only average about 19 mpg with my little 4-banger... :blush: "
blueguydotcom,8-Mar," wow. diesel in san diego is $4.09 and premium is $3.79 near my house. for me, diesel is a savings compared to a normal bimmer (about $400 a year at current levels although gas will surely get more expensive).. "
cdnpinhead,8-Mar," well, for starters, when i use your numbers i come up with $5028 for the oil burner vs. the (almost) same number you got for the gas. however, i'd submit (as have others) that a $1 delta between premium gas and diesel is an unusual situation, at least anywhere i'm likely to travel.besides which, i neither need nor want a  bmw . i'd buy a 2.0 or 2.5 tomorrow if they were available over here, and my experiences in the uk and europe is that i'll get closer to 40 mpg than 30 with either of those engines. now, if we were to re-run the calculation with a $0.50 delta between the two fuels and 33% less consumption for the diesel, i think that will be a more useful number, at least to me.however, to support your point a bit, diesel has nowhere near the demand flexibility that gasoline has. the trucks, locomotives, heating plants and other users of diesel and similar fuels (jet a for one) will keep right on consuming pretty much regardless of price, while passing the added expense along in the form of higher prices for whatever goods are being trans toyota d. as we've already seen over the past few weeks, when gasoline prices go up significantly, people use less -- it's discretionary to a much larger extent.should be interesting to see this play out.

sls002,8-Mar, perhaps the point of the diesel is that you would reduce your consumption of petroleum by about 25%. the side effect of more diesel vehicles is that diesel will be more expensive which offsets the cost savings one might expect. 
shipo,8-Mar," as i understand it, when crude oil is refined, there are a number of different fuel grades that come from the d toyota illates of various weights. in a typical barrel of crude oil the fuel grade d toyota illed byproducts work out to the following rough percentages:1) gasoline: 51%2) fuel oil (home heating oil and diesel): 15%3) jet fuel (kerosene): 12%4) still gas (unrefined natural gas?): 5%a couple of points: - as i understand it, the above percentages cannot be varied by much. - as the demand for petroleum based diesel fuel rises, there will be a commensurate rise in the production of gasoline. - i've   ""  kia hyundai heard  ""  kia hyundai  that one of the reasons (beyond taxes) that allows gasoline to be so inexpensive here in the states is because europe consumes so much diesel. - as the demand for diesel fuel rises (as a percentage of fuel required for passenger  car ) it stands to reason that the price of gasoline might actually drop.please understand that i am no expert in this area and i'm just throwing the above factoids out there to generate some discussion.best regards,shipo "
alltorque,8-Mar," i have just filled up volvo s6 d5, (here in u.k.) converting for us gallons and dollars it works out to $8.35 per usg. unleaded gasoling computes to $8.12. of course, most of that is taxes of one kind or another.at that sort of delta diesel is an easy choice and helps explain why we europeans are in love with diesels. on the other hand, the dutch research might be valid and we're all mad !

sls002,8-Mar," it is possible to   ""  kia hyundai crack  ""  kia hyundai  the oil and make the molecules into other products. heavier into lighter (fuel oil into gasoline). fuel (diesel and gasoline) can be made out of coal too, at a cost of about $45 per barrel. while not profitable when crude oil is less than $50 per barrel, it should now be very profitable.the point is that a barrel of crude oil can be refined into almost any combination of useful products. in the winter more fuel oil (like diesel) is made. in the summer more gasoline is made. if the entire barrel were made into one product, it would be mostly synthetic (that is manufactured) rather than natural. breaking down the heavier molecules into lighter ones is not too expensive but takes some energy.

shipo,8-Mar,"   ""  kia hyundai breaking down the heavier molecules into lighter ones is not too expensive but takes some energy.

circlew,8-Mar," so you are saying the demand is a factor over the grade of fuel produced. as demand goes up in the states for diesel consumption, shipo's point is well taken that the price for gas would follow a lower demand/price. i think another factor is the efficiency and demand of the truck diesels which are a large percentage of the us domestic commerce. if public transport demands more diesel, the price will rise. simple.i know the economy is there in europe but it remains to be seen how the us model for diesel plays out. interesting to say the least.regards,ow "
shipo,8-Mar,"   ""  kia hyundai i know the economy is there in europe but it remains to be seen how the us model for diesel plays out. interesting to say the least.

cdnpinhead,8-Mar," as my buddy on rowan & martin used to say, verrry interesting. i was under the impression that the percentages among the four basic fuel groups could be skewed significantly, but perhaps not.if gasoline is the volatile byproduct of making the kerosine (jet a) & diesel (heating oil) for which there are few substitutes. . .maybe i'll be keeping my new gas motor longer than i thought, not that that's a bad thing. "
cdnpinhead,8-Mar," i've also noticed that the uk charges a bit more for diesel than gasoline, but that the better fuel mileage  toyota es the day for the diesel. in germany, last i was there, the diesel was noticeably less expensive. in switzerland, not so much -- could have even been more, as in england.i still maintain that u.s. consumption of diesel fuel for  car  isn't likely to drive price trends anytime soon, but that it certainly appears to be at the mercy of the rest of the world and the other fuel oil consumers in north america. "
sls002,8-Mar," unfortunately the light crude oils where you could d toyota ill gasoline out in large quantities are mostly gone and the heavy crude oils that perdominate today are mostly asphalt (oh, perhaps not that bad :p ), but anyway cracking the heavy oils into lighter ones is easy. making heavier molecules out of lighter ones is more difficult i think, but the problem today is getting lighter molecules. "
sls002,8-Mar," the seasonal v honda tion in diesel prices has to do with home heating oil, which is basically the same thing as #2 diesel.  car  should use #1 diesel in winter, which is usually a bit higher priced than #2. "
texases,8-Mar," cracking the heavy oils into lighter ones is easynot really. some of that goes on, but not a lot. this is the root of a major problem, the increasing heavy oil fraction of today's production. we don't have an oil shortage, actually, we have a hydrogen shortage, for cracking the heavier oil fractions. and no, refineries are fine tuned to their input crudes, and can vary the mix very slightly once built. can you build a refinery with significant flexibility? yes, but that does little for the large number of ex toyota ing set of refineries.

tayl0rd,8-Mar," ... we don't have an oil shortage, actually, we have a hydrogen shortage...we have a shortage of the most abundant element in the universe??? :surprise: :surprise: "
texases,8-Mar," maybe better to call it a hydrogenation shortage, but usable hydrogen isn't abundant, either - it's all tied up in water, etc. "
sls002,8-Mar," i think that you are misinformed. if what you say is true, then asphalt should be getting cheaper, but that is not the case. here road projects are in some doubt as asphalt has gotten too expensive.however, i will agree that the refinery is tuned to output a certain mix of products based on the crude oil that is available. this tuning is adjusted from winter to summer to increase gasoline or heating oil (basically diesel). "
texases,8-Mar," my source is a refinery engineer with 25 years experience. to quote:  ""  kia hyundai the current u.s. refining industry has only limited capability to generate more diesel versus gasoline in the short term. in fact, i personally believe the diesel market in the u.s. will not take off like it did in europe for two reasons: 1) europe's rapid dieselization was heavily subsidized by preferential tax policies vs. gasoline. this type of aggressive social engineering is not as likely to occur in the u.s. 2) europe's dieselization was essentially   ""  kia hyundai costless  ""  kia hyundai  in terms of refining capital expenditures, as european refiners simply cranked up their excess refining capa honda  to make more diesel and gasoline, selling the excess gasoline to the u.s. in fact, the u.s. imports roughly 1 million barrels of gasoline and gasoline components from europe every day. in other words, europe's dieselization was done on the back of the u.s.'s continued consumption of (relatively cheap) gasoline. if the u.s. were to   ""  kia hyundai dieselize  ""  kia hyundai  in any significant manner, it would require 10's of billions of dollars in refining capital expenditures for process units such as hydrocrackers to shift the product mix from 2/3 gasoline ~ 1/3 diesel to half & half gasoline and diesel.

sls002,8-Apr," if you look at shipo's references and follow on with some of the other references you will find that the v6 needs counter balancing to run smoothly. with counter balancing the v8 is very smooth running. i think shipo's point was that the inline six without counter balancing is smooth running, while other engines require some sort of balancing.as i see it, the size of an inline six for any particular vehicle will be limited by how much space is given to the hood length. for the same hood length, a v-engine will take up less space and can therefore be larger than the inline six, for up to 12 cylinders.

"
shipo,8-Apr," ummm, i'm thinking that you've grossly misinterpreted what you quoted from wikipedia. true, most v6 engines use a three throw crank with some form of an offset between paired connecting rods to achieve an even 120 degree firing interval, however, even the 60 degree engines that use flying arms (an arm that reaches between connecting rods and extends from the throw back through the axis of the crank and some d toyota ance beyond) have no more complicated connecting rod assemblies than an inline engine. fwiw, flying arms are cast into the crank itself, they don't move independently and other than a little machining to remove a small amount of metal in the balancing process, require no extra work during engine assembly.actually, when looked at from a part count perspective, v6 crank shaft, crank bearing, and connecting rod assemblies (bearings included) are actually simpler than an i6. why is that? simple, your typical v6 only uses four main bearings with a single 2-cylinder offset throw in between each main pair, however, your typical i6 uses seven main bearings with each cylinder having its own throw situated between main pairs. in spite of this difference, i6 engines usually have a considerably lower parts count compared to a v6 of an otherwise similar design.best regards,shipo "

markcincinnati,8-Apr," why pay $5,300 more for a car that has a heavier front end, takes more gasoline to propel it and has 15 ft lbs less torque -- and that the torque it does have comes on at thousands of rpm's higher?i had an allroad 2.7t and i had also had three audi  car  with the 4.2 v8 (one  audi  and two  audi 's) -- so when it came time to order the allroad, i test drove another sort of similar car, an  audi  2.7t. torque rules.and in the example above, the v8 had 295 ft pounds of torque vs the v6's 258 ft pounds, yet the v6 was quicker because the torque came on (in the v6) at below 2,000 rpms and the v8 didn't come up to full boil until north of 3500 rpms.in this case, the new 2.0tfsi has 258 ft pounds, below 2000 rpms and the 3.2fsi has 243 at north of 3200 rpms -- this is a no brainer.the v6 imho is for the consumer who wants to talk about the 265hp v6 (despite its lower torque.)had audi offered the engine competing with the bmw 335 i6 turbo, well, that might have been a horse(power) of a different color.i believe the  audi  2.0t will be the car of choice for about 10-12 months in the  audi  family; the v6 being offered solely for marketing reasons (  ""  kia hyundai wouldn't do,  ""  kia hyundai  to have this car without a v6 in the brochure, kind of thing.)i may, but i doubt it, regret this decision. but the handling, mileage and performance of the 2.0tfsi should be superior in cincinnati oh (where it will see most of its duty.) it will easily top any speed limit we have in these parts (just as easily as the v6) and its quickness, for a while at least, will be unequaled -- at least until the supercharged v6 comes out in a year or so.another  audi  3.2 certainly was an option -- but the new  audi  will have a 110+  ""  kia hyundai  wheel base, the  audi  is 111+  ""  kia hyundai  -- the balance, rwd biased  audi , sport package and other amenities and luxuries in the premium plus package makes the  audi  2.0tfsi a   ""  kia hyundai better  ""  kia hyundai  choice for someone who wants cts style luxury (at least) and very bmw like performance and handling -- in a handsome package.rationalization?perhaps -- but there are just too many head to head ( audi  vs  audi ) test reports and reviews of this new  audi  to make me wonder   ""  kia hyundai who in their right mind would pay more for less?

"
blueguydotcom,8-May," no, the sport package still feels like a buick. "
tayl0rd,8-May," i don't know if i'd go that far. even the non-sport doesn't feel like a buick. that was my first extended time with a  bmw  and i put it through some paces. it handles really well, though it will understeer on you when you start pushing the limit. and the steering's not quite as quick as i like. the sport package is much better as far as handling's concerned. i haven't driven a  bmw  sport long enough to really test the steering.here's a strange one for you. i test drove an  bmw  sedan and it's suspension actually felt softer than my 550i sport! :surprise: (it didn't have the adjustable suspension.) go figure! but boy was it precise in direction. and getting back in my 550i after the  bmw , i could really feel the heft of the  bmw  over the  bmw .

plekto,8-May, check out the weight of one. close to 2 tons. the reason it's quiet is because they have added several hundred pounds of materials to dampen it like a buick or a   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz .handling is nowhere as good as the 3 series a decade ago as a result of being 700lbs or so heavier. 
tayl0rd,8-May," there aren't   ""  kia hyundai several hundred pounds  ""  kia hyundai  of sound dampening material. the vast majority of the weight comes from safety equipment, amenties, and chassis stiffening/bracing. "
sls002,8-May," the increase in weight is due to the body's larger size (#1) and stiffer structure (#2). the new 1-series is a return to a smaller body, but they are using the 3 series platform so it has the same weight problem. "
plekto,8-May,"   ""  kia hyundai stiffer structure  ""  kia hyundai  means more metal and dampening materials. the safety equipment between 1998 and 2008 isn't actually that different. maybe 100lbs more, if that, since the older models came pretty much with everything that was available at the time.

blueguydotcom,8-Jun," depends on the buyer. if you're buying for luxury the is250 seems like the ticket (and that ticket is very expensive). if you want space for people, utility, power (it's got gobs more than the is250) and still a small package, then the  audi 's golden (and priced nicely). personally, i detested the is (even the 350) and find the  audi  allows us to do everything - pick up passengers, go on a run to home depot for larger items, smooth, effortless power. the handling's not as sharp as i would like and there's road noise from the cruddy all-season tires. gas mileage, when i drive it, tends to be in the mid to high 20s. outside of the rwd layout, which lexus numbed down to the point that the car understeers like a fwd, i can't personally see the value in the far more expensive, less powerful, less useful is250. "
jzalkin,8-Jun," i owned an  audi  cab (sold at 56,00 miles) and now have the is250 (36,500 miles). here are my thoughts.quality is a lot better in the lexus. forget the big items as the small stuff makes for greater frustration. i always had a few things in the audi that needed to get addressed every service (broken small pieces, peeling of plastic coating, etc), but not with the lexus. the lexus is put together great. i know why they have loyalty because there are so few complaints on the small annoying things as the car ages. i guess that is why there are a lot of last gen lexus driving around that people love. service varies, but around south florida, the lexus experience is top shelf (better than audi). i almost never have a l toyota  of little things to be addressed at the service intervals.the audi feels sportier and has a roughness that reinforces that. the lexus is serene and the quietness/plushness reinforces that. both get old at times, but you have to decide your preference. i can't compare engines as my  audi  cab was heavy and did not perform any better than the is250. i get great gas mileage and do not want any more hp in my car given fuel prices. with prices expected to hit $4.50 by end of july (premium - see record oil prices today and stock market plunge) i wouldn't mind giving up even more hp for even better gas mileage. the  audi  is more  nissan tile, but can't touch the lexus for overall luxury. plus, the lexus v6 is smooth and does have plenty of umph when needed. i loved the audi and await the  audi  convertible, but unless you carry a lot of things that you need the  audi  for space - i think the lexus is the better choice. i was not inclined to keep the audi out of warranty, but will not hesitate to keep the lexus based on my personal experience.

ghstudio,8-Jun," the nissan/infiniti engine is one of the really solid engines...it's still the base for the current nissan/infiniti engines. it is not the most thrify on gas, neither is it the worst. it is possible that not using high test is effecting your mileage, but i've tried 93 octane and 87 octane in my 06  bmw 5 and i've seen no difference in mpg or pep. a larger factor is ethanol in your gasoline (unavoidable today) which gives you less mpg then 100% gasoline. i doubt that octane is causing any problem in this engine however you can try three tanks of high test and see if you see any significant difference.fuel guage is what it is...i think it was the old bmw where they made the guage for the last 1/4 tank of gas almost 3/4 of the guage. it's rare that it matters how full the tank is when it shows full...but it really does matter when you're down to 1/8 a tank.high performance plugs and   ""  kia hyundai high efficiency  ""  kia hyundai  air cleaners do almost nothing in a modern engine. actually, most all additives also do nothing, in fact most car makers recommend against using any additives in the car. if you aren't driving aggressively, then about the only thing you can do that will really improve mileage is to turn off the a/c.

(don't get me started on stuff like keys)the raw data suggests the following arrangement::1:infiniti2:lexus(toyota is now almost as expensive for parts as volvo, unfortunately. their transmissions are a known hugely expensive problem as well)3:4:cadillac/acura (they tend to switch back and forth - acura breaks less often, cadillac costs less to fix - nearly a tie as a result)5:6:7:8:(all the rest start here)there's a tiny gap between lexus and infiniti, then a small one to cadillac(major improvement in the last decade) and acura, and then a large drop down to the rest. i think what does it is that it's really nissan, toyota, and honda versus the rest. in japan, there is only one product line - and the premium models are just that - the upper end models of the normal line.

tlong,10-Feb," one only worries about depreciation if one is going to sell almost immediately. it is not a financially good decision to buy a car with selling it in three years in the back of your mind. if you are going to do that leasing is available. this is a silly argument we are having. even if you drive a car for 10 years, if it cost $45k new and $5k in 10 years = $40k = $4k/year in depreciation.if you buy a new  toyota  for $30k and it costs $3k in 10 years = $27k = $2.7k/year.so the ellps is $1.3k/year more expensive due to depreciation. which is why i'm saying that maintenance should not be a big factor. you would have to average $1300/year more in maintenance costs on the  toyota  per year to equal the much larger cost of the ellps purchase. so the ellps is a lot more expensive to own. and that is why even a grand or two every few years in maintenance costs is not that big. it has nothing to do with how long you keep the vehicle. maintenance is not a large part of the ownership costs. and i haven't even brought up the costs for insurance, etc.so if you like an ellps and you can afford it, buy or lease it and don't worry about the maintenance costs, or perhaps you can't afford the vehicle in the first place. if you want a real worry, then the relative risk of breaking down or of time in the shop is probably more important, since that is a convenience issue rather than a cost issue. "
plekto,10-Feb," tco has a huge problem with it.1: depreciation isn't a factor in comparing cost to fix/repair/upkeep a vehicle. also, neither is stuff like insurance. yes, it matters, but not to compare which vehicles are the least expensive to keep running(you really only lose money when you sell the car, if you ever do - or to be more accurate, you only get back the difference in depreciation when/if you sell it)2: the first years where the factory warranty is in place artificially skew the results. bmw comes out well by this measure because it does cost you nothing to keep the car running, or nearly so. but try that with a 5 year old bmw...tco is pretty worthless, really.just looking at the data i posted - if you go back to 2005, you'll see lexus is taking about half of the spots. infiniti and cadillac vastly improved their quality since then and lexus slipped a bit down to where honda/acura is.(still very good, especially if you get a car with manual)link titlethe problem is that costs to fix things is skyrocketing. a replacement transmission in a  toyota , for instance, runs over $3500 now. that's just silly. bumpers and other components that get scuffed or cracked are hideously expensive. want to replace a toyota or bmw or well, almost any car's headlight assembly? so if one company can come in with less frequency and/or less cost per part than the competition, it wins.   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz , audi, and bmw flat-out fail here. volvo is also notoriously pricey to fix. acura and infiniti are a bit better, as is cadillac(they take grief about not using the best newest tech, but then again, that's less stuff to break as well) toyota just has  problem  recently and i'd not recommend anything with an automatic or etc(electronic throttle control) on it from them.(that's 80%+ of their line currently.

kdshapiro,10-Feb," there's that  chevrolet ion again, lies, damn lies and stat toyota ics. you get to pick your metric and make your case based on your metric. there is no getting around it, the more expensive the car the more it costs to own.for example: in my area a rebuilt  pontiac 5 tranny is almost $2k, but a rebuilt  toyota  tranny is $700. not sure where you get your figures from. a headlight assembly for a  infiniti  is nearly $800. ouch.if you are saying an infiniti tranny breaks less often than a  toyota  tranny after the warranty period, you would have to point to some credible source for me to believe it. not just a cr survey.but it still boils down to will *your* car have an issue, and if it does what will it take to repair it. my bmw can be cheaper to own on a parts basis against a used  honda  if nothing breaks on it and the  honda  is constantly under repair. "
plekto,10-Feb," i suppose if the rebuilt  toyota  transmission is a generation or two old and has no warranty and is out of some shop in the middle of the industrial section of town, you might find one for $700. but here in los angeles, a 4-5 year old  toyota  automatic is well over $3000 by the time you write the final check. the best i could find locally was $2100 with a warranty, not counting labor, shipping, tax(etc) and a core charge. the cts transmission was only $1600. now $500 might not be a huge amount to some people, but that's more than i spent last year on maintainance on my 4x4.with that sort of potential repair and the issues that keep coming up(plus the new  toyota  recall, now!) i can't recommend toyota other than for their trucks. "
kdshapiro,10-Feb," who buys a new transmission? almost nobody? it must be a regional thing. the numbers i cited were local. it must be a supply and demand issue in the la area, which is a very narrow slice of information to make a broad generalization on.the other potential reason for the difference is that cts trannies may be crap, you get what you pay for.i have no  problem  with toyota, i would buy any of their  car  in a heartbeat, recalls or not, doesn't bother me in the least. i really like the  toyota  se and am mulling over buying it.

plekto,10-Feb," automatic transmissions live and die based upon their electronics and hydraulic components. often when the system fails, the oil overheats and cooks the inside or damages something and the entire thing turns into a brick that needs to be completely pulled apart and rebuilt. as, say, opposed to an old hydraulic only design like ford and gm used to make a decade or two ago - just replace the torque converter 90% of the time for cheap and you're done.($800-$1200 repair vs a whole new unit)  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  makes its  car  in europe with manuals only, essentially. they add in an automatic to placate the rental fleets and taxi users and the like. as a result, it's almost like an aftermarket accessory in their minds - just put something in and ship it out the door, who cares as it's not going to someone who cares or can't afford the maintainance. they don't re-design the transmissions for export, and so you get a great car with a chrysler quality automatic stuffed in it(trust me - the designs are still very similar on the automatics).the only way to avoid this is to buy a manual like 80%+ of europe does. the problem is, of course, that almost nothing shipped to the u.s. by   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz (or most other makers other than  volkswagen ) is offered with a manual.

qbrozen,10-Feb," my volvo is right around the $4k-$4500 mark, and that is for a rebuilt trans (no such thing as a new '01 auto trans). and many folks tell me i am guaranteed to need a replacement during my ownership.there is one other choice, though. a full manual trans conversion. even that will run close to $3k, though, and that's with me doing all the labor myself.

kdshapiro,10-Feb," i don't understand the issue. a lot of people i know own german made brands, nobody is sending their mechanics to easy street, and everybody can talk about their favorite (insert your manufacturer here) horror story. one reason i don't take any maintenance and repair board to heart when buying a car is because people complain before they kvell. i found out long ago, trying to be the perfect stat toyota ic  honda ing to any automotive survey is a crap shoot, so i don't buy  honda ing to those either. do i care what jd powers has to say? not really.manufacturers make warranties to fix  car  that have issues. i buy the car i like and let the chips fall where they may. i don't worry about things. that's what lemon laws are for, although i've never needed to use them. the manfacturer who holds the d toyota inction for the most trips to the dealer is nissan. so needless to say i have no burning desire to own anymore models from them or their luxury brand.one last thing, if one spends a cool .5 million on a car your logic suggests it would be bullet-proof, since honda can make a  honda  nearly bullet-proof. however, it aint so, is it? infiniti can't even make a  pontiac 5 as bullet proof as a  honda . at least a  honda  as far as i know has never had a recall to fix an issue that cause cause an engine fire.

rayainsw,10-Feb," as mentioned above, the 2 top contenders for my next car are currently the bmw  bmw s & the audi s4.i learned something about the audi transmission behavior since i tested the first one available in the atlanta area. so i decided to take another short test drive on saturday morning. to see if what i had learned had a significant effect of the aspects of the dual clutch seven speed s tronic trans. behavior that had concerned me in my previous test drive.and the short answer is: yes.the fact that i did not know is the ex toyota ence of a kickdown switch in the s4&#146;s throttle travel.from page 134 of the owner&#146;s manual:&#147;kick-downkick-down enables maximum acceleration.when you press the accelerator pedal down beyond the res toyota ance point, the automatic transmission downshifts into a lower gear, depending on vehicle speed and engine rpm. it shifts up into the next higher gear once the maximum specified engine rpm is reached&#148;my two objections to the transmission, when i drove one before, both had to do with the &#145;manual-ness&#146; of the s tronic when in &#147;manual mode&#148;. 1 - the automatic transmission downshifted when in manual mode & i floored the throttle. what i expected was: when in manual mode, remain in the gear selected, regardless of throttle position.2 &#150; my commands to upshift before redline when accelerating at wot were [ ahem ] declined. completely ignored.it turns out that i must have pressed right past that &#145;res toyota ance point&#146;, and this caused the behaviors i observed.[ i did not know about this &#145;feature&#146; &#150; nor did the sales associate, when i questioned him about this. ]so, this kickdown \ res toyota ance point at wot actually addresses both my criticisms. not pushing through this &#145;kick down&#146; switch makes a huge difference, for me.with substantial throttle [ essentially wot, but not quite &#145;foot to the floor&#146; ] the upshift commands are answered &#150; quickly. and the shifts occur almost immediately &#150; and with authority. very quick, but not jarring. excellent. and almost surreal.and avoiding this switch also means no [ unwanted ] downshifts in manual mode, based only on throttle opening. we&#146;re good. i also confirmed that the trans. will upshift at red line &#150; not hang on rev limiter! the behavior i prefer. so &#150; i&#146;d still prefer that the trans. &#145;gear selected&#146; display be a bit larger, and higher in the dash display. . . but i can live with the current presentation, i suppose.and there is still one thing i do find somewhat annoying about the trans. at very low speeds, it automatically downshifts all the way to first &#150; making it difficult to drive smoothly at parking lot speeds.the rest of the car is impressive, to me: interior  toyota , materials & styling appeal to me.the handling is impressive.the handling feel, particularly considering the significant front weight bias, was quite responsive & satisfying.the ride was a bit harsh on cratered back streets, but this s4 had the 19&#148; tires & wheels &#150; where i&#146;d likely stick with the standard 18s.and the audi drive select package &#150; that includes the sport rear diff.for european delivery.excellent.it is remotely possible that the  bmw s, with 370 tq and the performance exhaust may seduce me &#150; but, for now, the s4 is at the top of my &#145;short l toyota &#146;.- ray[ note: it appears unlikely that the  bmw s will be available for test at a dealer before this june or july. sigh. ] "
plekto,10-Feb," i hear you about the odd transmissions. my biggest gripe is that when in manual mode, most will behave correctly until they think they should do something else and you are suddenly not in control. a great example was when i was test-driving a  mazda  a while back. at least it has the general concept right in that it stays in the gear you select most of the time. so leaving it in 3rd running around town was fine, and there was enough engine compression to work fine(as long as you didn't hit the brakes).but when slowing down, it would do odd things. say, i was going 35 and decided to slow down to 20. it would always drop into top gear and then wait. then when it thought i was at the right speed, select a gear for me. now, i know this is supposedly to keep the car from stalling with idiot drivers, but the second that you tapped the brakes, the engine reverted to automatic. so a simple maneuver of slowing from 35 to 20 in 2nd gear and then powering out of the corner wasn't possible if you used your brakes even the slightest bit. what happened was 35(tap brakes to slow down a little bit... shifts to overdrive(!), then when you hit the gas again in the middle of the turn, it selected 3rd(reverted to automatic mode - have to satisfy the epa mpg tests). then you had to manually downshift it to 2nd/override its behavior to power out of the turn.it felt a lot like when you're at the top of a hill on a roller  toyota  and the thing disconnects from the chain. tick tick tick tick (full second of nothing happening as you are  honda  from the mechanism) going from 2nd to 5th in a turn feels like you just dropped into neutral as the engine compression evaporates completely. on the  mazda , it was very disconcerting since the thing has no torque at all unless it's revved up to 3-4k+ it should have just stayed in 2nd the whole time. instead i got this feeling of the drive shaft being disconnected every time i hit the brakes to slow down a tiny bit. which given the mile high gearing on most  car  these days is impossible no to do - leaving it in gear to slow down takes ages.now some do better than others, but the thing is, just get a manual if they offer it. no idiocy, cheaper to repair and buy, and it behaves like it should at all times.btw, check out the  infiniti . it impressed me.

slance66,10-May," well every car on my l toyota  is a   ""  kia hyundai luxury  ""  kia hyundai  brand and this is the entry level luxury form. i mentioned the mazda only because it seems all around capable. the only gm i've ever owned is a 1970 cutlass convertible. i have planned on continuing that streak. i find the cts mostly unattractive, and it was unfortunate that acura has been copying all the harsh angles. the new  buick  is good looking, but i'm just not that old. there is no way a  pontiac  will ever get up my driveway in winter, and the styling? maybe when i was 15. i'd get a cts first for sure.i feel like the default pick is a  bmw , but the run-flat tires don't appeal and the out of warranty service could be a problem. maybe i should chance the audi reliability with an  audi . it does everything else well. "
plekto,10-May," the previous generation cts is a lot less ugly than the new one and would be my pick, then. the pearl white and light blue are very nice and are aimed at female buyers. you might not like the cts, but your wife probably will love it after a test drive after her old car she's been suffering with.i know this as my mother is looking for the exact same type of car - and the cts keeps staying on her top 3 l toyota .that's a nice car - lighter colors hide the angles a lot.look, the simple fact is that anything from bmw, audi, or   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  will literally cost you thousands a year in repairs and maintainance once it's out of warranty. i'm talking about idiocy like $6000-$12000 transmissions and $500 for a sensor under the hood. you have been warned if you go down that path. and, it's not really luxury to put pleather in a car these days.(no typo - real leather starts typically in the 40-60k+ range) simply put, if you can't afford it new, these will destroy you financially, used.****07 lexus e350: fwd? isn't this a  toyota ?07 lexus is250 awd: slow? backseat a bad joke?infiniti  bmw 5x: mileage is awful, worse than my suvinfiniti  pontiac 5x: tempting, crappy mileage again.acura rl: wife hated it.acura tl: ??? new one is hideous.acua  acura : too small...glorfied  honda . ****your original l toyota  immediately shrinks to this. lexus is largely bland, souless junk. (two exceptions though - i'll get to them in a bit). infiniti is great. the  infiniti   dodge  is fantastic. and, honestly, none of the awd system in  car  unless they are 100% full-time engaged actually work in bad weather. it's pure marketing and smoke and mirrors. so either get a 4x4 vehicle or something like a subaru that has full-time 4 wheel drive. or just get a 2wd vehicle and save money. note - this also gets you 2-5mpg back.interesting that you say that the new 2009  acura  is small - it's much larger than the older one and i thought it would be a perfect fit.anyways - the reason you consider domestic vehicles is because they depreciate quickly and yet are solidly engineered. i can guarantee that 95%+ of the people on this forum can't begin to reach the limits of a first generation cts, let alone something like a  infiniti . so, the two lexus exceptions you should look at:the is300 was perhaps the closest thing japan ever made to a 3 series in terms of getting that small european sport sedan feel. they also are one of the least expensive luxury sport  sedan  ever made in terms of repairs and upkeep. i'd look at one - and actually drive it before you pass on it, because it is a great car to drive. i'd also say the same thing about a 2007 cts - drive it and then decide if it's bad or not. the other one is a 2005 lexus gs300. what makes this car special is that it is rwd and has a 3.0l inline 6 engine. as a result, it has great reliability, smoothness, power, and does it while getting good mpg. there's a reason bmw and uses inline 6 engines, and lexus got it exactly right with both the is300 and the gs300(same engine, btw, in both).why did they change? they worshiped hp and marketing more than building a perfect compromise. then again, to be honest, both designs are dated compared to the cts, which was a real game changer. other than that, you're looking at a volvo or maybe a suv. the reality is fo rused  car :japan - reliable, expensive to fix, costly to buy used.(depreciate too slowly)gm - less reliable, inexpensive to fix, reasonably priced.(depreciate normally)bmw/  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz /audi - terrible reliability, insane to fix, reasonably priced.(depreciate like a rock) "

plekto,10-May," i am still searching for the european driving experience together with the japanese reliability. let me know when you find it. one car fits that bill, a used is300. i know, i drove everything, and the only *japanese* car in your price range that feels like a european model is that one.now, domestics have that as well, though reliability is a little less. it's still worlds better than bmw or audi, though. gm has spent a lot of time testing their  car  in germany lately, and the  pontiac , cts, and a few others show it. they feel properly   ""  kia hyundai european  ""  kia hyundai  as well.

"
plekto,10-May," ah. bit clearer now. the  infiniti  sedan is your likely best bet, then. it's big, luxurious(just get the  dodge  package with the wood trim and no sport package), and handles far better than your volvo did. it also costs the least per repair of any of the luxury models, so that's a plus. it's a much more refined car than the  pontiac 5, which felt like a 4 door z. imo, it's critical to get the wood and interior premium packages with the infiniti and tl/ acura  and not to get the upgraded suspension or tires. the stock suspension is exactly firm enough and gives the car a slightly sedate feel on highway roads as opposed to jarring you to death for that extra 5% grip.there is one more option as well, but that's only if you like manual transmissions. the   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  c class is actually a perfectly decent vehicle if you don't get a sunroof, nav, or anything that is electronic or a gadget that can break and get manual as well. of course, less than 5% came as base models like this(leather, wood trim, etc, but no electronics), so it can be hard to find the exact right one. avoid automatics - the repair bill on one is reason enough to never get anything from   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  with an automatic.the gem of course was a 2003-2005 c230k *sedan*. the replacement for it is a tremendous seller in europe(now c300k, iirc). it gets a legitimate 35 mpg highway and is the   ""  kia hyundai real deal  ""  kia hyundai . but only if you get manual. (the manual is easily as refined as the 3 series - almost video game easy) "
roadburner,10-May," a bmw won't be as inexpensive to run as a honda, but they are nowhere near as expensive to maintain as the urban  acura s some like to parrot. since 1983 i've always had one or more  bmw  in the garage; i currently own a 1995 3 series as well as a 2004 x3(and a 1975 2002- but that's a ho toyota y car). the  bmw  has 121k miles on it and the x3 has 92k miles on the clock. maintenance and repair costs for both are averaging @5 cents per mile(in the case of the x3, that number is calculated over the 42k miles after the free maintenance plan expired). non-scheduled repairs on the  bmw  have cons toyota ed of a brake light switch, a thermostat, and the serpentine belt idler pullies. the x3 has required a passenger seat srs sensor(replaced under warranty). of the  car  you mentioned, i'd take an e39 530i- with the sport package, of course. it's a fantastic car; many enthusiasts(myself included) think that it is superior to its e60 successor.as for non  bmw , i'd also take a look at the  mazda peed 6. i find the lexus models to be terribly unsafe;if i drove one i'd almost certainly die of boredom...  "
slance66,10-May," yeah  infiniti  looks nice, but is beyond my   ""  kia hyundai no car payments  ""  kia hyundai  price point, since it's a new model. i drove a  pontiac 5x, and liked it except that what i'd like even more is a detuned model with 230-240hp and better mileage. the 4 door z description is right on. where is the balance? i agree on the wood in the inifiniti and acura, the metal looks too   ""  kia hyundai techno  ""  kia hyundai  and cold, and agree on the suspension and tires. anything less than an aspect ratio of 55 is way too hard to handle our broken new england pavement without punishing your kidneys.i don't need nav...i would opt for it in a japanese car, as i expect it to be trouble free. i can't get a manual, as my wife can't drive them. so auto it is, but i like the idea of de-electifying a mb. i really like the 2008+ c class, looks better and the prior version was awfully small in the back. prices are still high though. haven't checked the 03-05, but will look at specs. i had the same thought with bmw...a 525xi with no i-drive. i'd rather a nice cupholder than that knob. at least mbs have cupholders.

slance66,10-May," roadburner, if i had an indi bmw mechanic nearby, i'd probably put an e39 530i near the top of my l toyota . i've seen several of them for sale, at good prices. snow tires and wheels would be a definite expense however, for any rwd car. even then i'd worry about my steep driveway, but a 5 series should have good weight d toyota ribution. are there any known big expenses with those (i assume timing belt...what mileage?). "
plekto,10-May," the base  infiniti  starts at almost exactly $30k new( car  direct has one for $30,200 after $1k in incentives!) so used run 4-8k less. the  dodge  with premium and maple wood  hyundai s(2010 only  ) is $34,115(advertised street price). so 25k for a 1-2 year old example is possible to find. yes, it surprised me as well - it seems like a steal at that price.http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=u&car_id=278031393this is a nice color combo - though it's not the  dodge  with wood trim and all of that. edit - these two are different shades of blue...http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=p&car_id=272067925typical private party price. it's a stunning color in person and looks like a very expensive car. doubly so since it's the new model. i know how women want to be seen in the new model if possible  maybe it's not required, but it's certainly a feather in their cap if it's new bling vs old bling. my brain also did a double-take at these prices. if you can wait until september when the 2011 models come out, a 2010 with that nice wood trim will be available in the 25k range.edit - they have 0% and 2.9% financing now, so this fall, expect great incentives on a 2010. i can't find one, but the light interior and wood trim makes it feel much more luxury inside. "
roadburner,10-May," no us spec bmw engine has used a timing belt since late 1991. the cooling system is the only major issue. most owners practice preventative maintenance and replace the water pump, thermostat, and radiator at @100k miles. my indie shop charged me @$1000 to do the work on my wife's  bmw  back in 2005(it's an easy afternoon diy job but it was the middle of winter and my wife needed the car pronto). i bought a set of winter tires/wheels and changed them out myself in november and march; the car had no trouble in any sort of winter weather. there's a great e39 group non yahoo as well as several websites dedicated to the e39. it is just a fantastic car. as a matter of fact, i'm considering picking up a low-mileage e39  bmw  for a daily driver/track toy. "
slance66,10-May," some nice possibilities, especially at that price. hopefully the new auto tames it a bit, but it shocks me that they don't make a version with better mileage at 250hp. they would sell loads of them (just like teh 328 outsells the 335 by a lot). the interior is much more m like. mpg is terrible, so i'd honestly probably just get an  bmw 5x instead, since it is plenty fast enough for me, and there are lots of used ones. need to drive a 2003 530i too..and probably a few others. "
plekto,10-May," well, funny you should mention that... :p the  infiniti  is coming out this fall. same car, smaller ~220hp engine. the base model should be in the $27-28k range(msrp at $29-30k would be my guess, invoice closer to $27k). finding a prog dodge /dealer car a few months old for $25k should be possible. that is, if you can wait 5-6 months.and, yes, the automatic tames it quite a bit. it drives more like a 5 series or e class than a z. (that  toyota d, yes, it will make scenery go by very, very fast.)there are pictures online but nissan is keeping very mum about the car. my guess is that they want the competition to get theirs out first and under-cut them. i'd suspect that they are worried about the is250 and the new  buick , though the  buick  is out now, so we might expect a major announcement sometime soon.edit:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nissan_skylineit's sold as the skyline 250gt(same exact car as the  infiniti , essentially) and is currently on sale in japan. the combined fuel economy for the car (testing comes from singapore, of all places) l toyota s it as roughly 24-25mpg combined, with a highway figure of close to 35mpg. one site in japan l toyota s it as getting 38mpg in a test, but that was on a track under controlled conditions. and it should weigh about 3250lbs - about 300lbs lighter than the  infiniti . this will make it a great car among people who like mountain roads, since the only complaint with the  infiniti /z370 is its weight is a bit more than you'd like for serious mountain roads. infiniti  5.6 seconds. infiniti  7.0 seconds. (that's about a second faster than the is250 and  buick )it's not stupidly fast, but it certainly isn't a slouch, either. getting that type of performance out of a tiny engine like that is amazing, really. if they pull it off, it'll be the equivalent of a hat-trick. low cost, sport/luxury, and economy car mpg. all while not being slow. "
slance66,10-May," interesting...looks like they dropped a beefed up version of the 2.5l four from the  nissan  in? or is this a smaller displacement v6?. i really like the small 6 in the is250 and the efficient 6 in the 328. i can't see paying premium prices for anything with a 4, although i've considered it with the audi/ volkswagen  2.0t. i wonder where the weight drop comes from? 7 sec 0-60 is not bad at all. fortunately, i do have time...no hurry really.***just read a few reports. no turbo, 2.5l v6, specs around the 220 mentioned. of course some writers asked   ""  kia hyundai why move downmarket  ""  kia hyundai . do these writers live in the real world? not long ago, 220 was pretty powerful...300 was reserved for rarified company. this is a brilliant move. "
plekto,10-May," yeah, 220hp is plenty, as it comes close to the 15lbs/hp make-or-break sweet spot. (14.7 actually) for reference, that is 3000lbs and 200hp plus at least 200lb-ft of torque.(basically a 6 cylinder engine, preferably as small and quick to rev as possible)the is300 was very close to this magic ratio. bmw has tried to maintain this as well, though the recent 3 series' are too fat and suffers greatly in handling compared to the e36, which is still the best choice - it's the last   ""  kia hyundai classic  ""  kia hyundai  bmw worth getting. but, at 10 year old, now, it's a dicey proposition due to maintainance.that's why the 1 series is so popular - lighter and quicker on its feet for a fairly reasonable price. it eeks just under the 3000lb limit/ proper ratio. very fun to drive as a result.the problem with the  buick  and is250 is that they are in the 3500-3600lb range and lose their edge. not *quite* fast enough, not *quite*  chevrolet  enough. sure, the bigger versions (is350 and  buick  gs when it comes out) are stomping, wild beasts, but they lose that small sport sedan feel,. and they cost a lot more money. "
qbrozen,10-May," i'd be surprised if they could cut 300 lbs compared to the  infiniti . i mean, we're talking same platform. changing just the engine wouldn't save that much. unless they are going to use lightened body panels, which would add cost, i don't see it happening. "
markcincinnati,10-May," . . .why not look at a new  hyundai  (with the 6) sedan. a friend of mine bought one and he says the deals on them are   ""  kia hyundai impressive.

qbrozen,10-May," lack of awd is a drawback.only if you are offroading or deal with 6 months of snow, imho.i made it through 3 blizzards this year with a '92    mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz   with snow tires. no traction control. no stability control. just the snow tires and an ant toyota uated abs. not one iota of d dodge a driving in horrible conditions (had to take 9-month pregnant wife to the hospital in the middle of the night after 2 feet had fallen and no signs of letting up). i'm a convert. i am no longer concerned about having a rwd daily driver. (although that is all i grew up with, so go figure why i, and so many other people, have forgotten we survived it then, so we'll survive it now.) "
slance66,10-May," on awd, i look at it this way: i have a 20 plus degree grade in my driveway, so hill climbing is critical. rwd will suffer compared to awd at hill climbing, even with snow tires (it will better awd in stopping and turning with snows vs all weather). then there is the cost of buying wheels and tires, and paying for the changeover and storage (i have no room for 4 sets of wheels/tires). the cost probably evens out, but awd is just more convenient, and you don't have the occasional early or late snow, or the unusually warm winter days that chew up your snow tires. so i could give it a try...hell i grew up driving a 77 cougar in the snow...no abs, no traction control, and horrifically bad front/rear weight balance. of course it couldn't climb our snow covered driveway then either. "
plekto,10-May," if you have a 20 degree driveway, you need 4 wheel drive.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v= audi dvfy5cxt0&feature=relatedthe problem is that the systems try to out-think the situation and react too slowly. so they get stuck and actually in some cases literally stop turning any of the wheels despite the throttle being on full. 6:15 is the part to watch - a dirt hill climb.what appears to happen with most of them is that the system transfers enough power to the rear wheels to merely keep the vehicle's place stable on the hill and does the climbing with the fronts alone. this works to a point. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xjusljqbv8ouch.trust me - almost all of the drive systems that transfer power back and forth fail like this and are only good for getting unstuck from a flat snowy driveway or the side of a road. note - subaru and a few others are full-time awd and do work. part-time is ru toyota ish, so don't bother wasting your money.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxopcwmnc6c&feature=related4wd. just pay the extra money if you really need snow performance.snow tires are much more critical, though:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03wqclnq-0&feature=relateda nice video i found showing how awd isn't going to save you while snow tires likely will. there are 6 in the series - it's very informative, if a bit repetitive.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxuhfwy74b8a bit more funny  "

slance66,10-Jun," well the search continues. i drove a 2008 lexus is250 awd. not fast, but not a dog either. cockpit was nice, if slightly tight. i was very happy with the balance between handling and ride on out broken pavement. it's just quite small in back, and never inexpensive. wondering if i can suffer fwd again with an es, which would be bigger and faster...without the handling.next stop, a 2007 328xi. interior had many loose pieces and was a grade, no two grades below the lexus. hell the interior in my  subaru  was a grade better. ergonomics however, were perfect...armrest exactly where it is needed (subie's is 6 inches too low). seat was fine. more room in back than the is. now the drive...there wasn't one. battery was dead and couldn't be jumped. yes, bmw is off to a glorious start. don't even ask about cupholders. this same place has a 525xi and a mb e350 4matic. i'll give those a go instead.

plekto,10-Jun," if you look at the tread of a typical at tire, it's nearly identical to most non-directional all-season car tires. as such, it's worthless in snow and mud and really should be considered the truck equivalent of a street - only tire. now, for a lot of people, it works fine enough. they see a tiny bit of dirt and some  subaru  roads every so often. and for their soft-roader suvs, life is good.but for snow, you absolutely need mud terrain tires as a minimum. and 4x4 engaged. also, look for a tread pattern that has lots of sipes in it. the older bfg mud terrains were very bad in rain for this reason(zero sipes anywhere), though good otherwise.

nyccarguy,10-Jun, so you're happy with your tl sh awd? is yours stick or automatic? 
sweendogy,10-Jul, one in 6k tl's come in stick- very rare 
jtla,10-Jul," thanks for the link to 2011 volvo  volvo  t6 awd. i read it the first time you posted. the new  volvo  looks promising. i think its t6 engine power output -- 300 horsepower and 325 pound-feet of torque -- is among the top of this group, especially the torque. imo, volvo did a fine job in both exterior styling and interior layout. as to handling, we will have to wait until the car hits the showroom and do a proper test drive.while this car may be a legitimate contender, the biggest problem for volvo may be the lack of convincing reason for potential buyers to choose it over the competition. for performance, the  bmw  and  infiniti  still lead the pack. for luxurious feels, tl and  audi  may have the edge. for dependability reputation, the japanese brands are always safer bets. for badge shoppers, mb certainly sounds more prestigious. safety is volvo's strong suite, but others are not far behind. a volvo is just so easy to lost in this crowded segment. and its new chinese ownership doesn't help, either. "
sweendogy,10-Jul, jtla - yeah that past post is now gone- as is the one above your post- have to play by mr. edmunds rules or else. i agree with you the t6 pretty interesting with all the torque and have to agree its a tough sell in this market giving volvos past efforts in the space and the competitors-- but i do like the fact that they are doing something which intern will make the group better.

"
smarty666,10-Jul," excellent topic to say the least, considering i have a 3g fwd tl, a fwd  nissan , the new one, and a rwd infiniti i think i can add some decent  honda  on this. i can tell you this, the cvt does take a little away from making the  nissan  a true sports sedan, like a  infiniti  or  bmw , but that is only b/c of the noise during acceleration and lack of shift shock. the  nissan  is just as sporty as the 4g fwd tl, but fwd in itself does have limitations that rwd obviously and my 3g tl has a more sporty flair to it then the 7g  nissan . the new  nissan  has virtually no torque steer during brisk acceleration and i've been able to keep up with higher powered v6's with both a/t and mt so the power and performance of the  nissan  is not hindered by the cvt in the least. saying the  nissan  is a sportier version of an  toyota  is a little bit ridiculous to me. drive both  car  back to back and they are totally different. the  nissan 's handling is much more crisp and precise then just about anything else in the fwd market, except for say mazda maybe. i would go as far as to say, that the  nissan  is about as sporty as you can go in performance, driving  toyota mics, handling, etc for a fwd sedan without having to spend more money and go into a rwd luxury division vehicle. it is a four door sports sedan, no, the cvt and fwd layout prevent it becoming that, but its a sporty four door sedan. except for one or two things, the cvt is not as bad as people make it out to be. it takes a few months, but you get used to and then when you get back into a vehicle with a regular a/t and feel shift shock, you think something is wrong in regards to fitting into this thread category its tuff to say. the  nissan  is an oddity and hard to classify. its not from a luxury division and some people have difficulty using the word luxury and nissan in the same sentence and i can understand that. on the other hand, the power/performance, price, luxury sedan features, etc that you can get in this car would suggest and warrant at least a entry-level luxury classification. everyone will tell you something different b/c there are no books stating what car classes there are and what goes into what. i've heard people classify the  nissan  has followed over the years,   ""  kia hyundai entry-level luxury sedan,  ""  kia hyundai    ""  kia hyundai premium full-size sedan,  ""  kia hyundai    ""  kia hyundai near luxury sedan.  ""  kia hyundai  pick anyone you want and use it or whatever floats your boat. it really, in the grand scheme of things doesn't mean jack squat! "
kfdmed,10-Jul," have any driven the  nissan  cvt for any period of time? driven it in the sport mode? the cvt in sport mode does more than just give you shift shock ... the engine revs more like a traditional auto transmission. i once thought whats the point of artificial shifting in a cvt? after using it for a while i understand why they included with the cvt. i drove the base fwd tl and  nissan  back to back and dont think the tl is any more   ""  kia hyundai sporty  ""  kia hyundai  than the  nissan . "
smarty666,10-Jul," the 4g fwd tl is less sporty in my opinion then the 7g fwd  nissan , not by much but enough i noticed a difference. the  nissan  had a slightly firmer/sportier ride and feedback, slightly better handling, and the look of the actual vehicle was sportier. your right the cvt in sport mode does help to give the shift shock imitation, which is important in the feedback department, louder exhaust note upon acceleration when gunning it compared to regular drive, and the engine revs as you mentioned, all of which provides the sportier needs anyone would want from a regular a/t. now, once you move up to the awd 6 m/t version of the 4g tl, that the tl becomes sportier than the new  nissan , but the base version is definitely tamer then the new  nissan .remember, a lot of people have valid critisms and hatred of the cvt b/c of what happened with the 1g version of it from 2003-2008. since 2009, all the nissan products have the updated 2g cvt which is much more efficient, less troubles, and far fewer  problem  then the 1g had. nissan extended the transmission warranty so the cvt for them is here to stay! so far i overall really like the cvt and the fuel econ for 290hp is absolutely fabulous.

marcus216,10-Aug," i don''t think comparing the tl to the  audi , s4, 3 series, or  infiniti  is an accurate comparison due to the fact the the tl is considerably larger. why not compare the new infiniti m series to the s4 or a   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  e 350 to a  infiniti ? the only thing the tl has in common with the smaller  car  is price. i would not expect a tl to be able to run a slalom course with any of the above  car  due to the shear bulk of the tl compared to the others. 0-60 times have the same issue. i could care less whether a tl can beat an s4 to 60 mph. my tl sh-awd comes close to equaling most performance measures of an s4 . and when i entertain clients, i can put two full sized adults in the back seat of my tl in  toyota . and the l toyota  price of my tlwas about $9,000 less than a comparably equipped s4.

sweendogy,10-Aug," why do they make the rl then?? i think its great that the tl is roomy but so is a buick, in comparison tests the tl always ranks lower then  car  in its price class-(as noted in the 3 links i posted)-the class acura put this car in from the beginning --as an entry level lux sedan -- this is the class that makes it possible for other  car  under the lux line to ex toyota  because they sell alot of them.. if your driving an automatic tlawd and think it will outperform a s4, then you never drove an s4,-- tl is a good middle of the road sedan, in manual form its comes closer to s4 but no one here on these chats ownes a 6speed (infact one in 6k comes in manual....ronn knows this stat).. edmunds reviewed the 6speed-- its a different animal.http://www.edmunds.com/acura/tl/2010/testdrive.html "
marcus216,10-Aug," before my tl sh-awd purchase, i drove every midsize luxury performance sedan out there. e350, 5 series,  bmw 7, audi  audi , gs 350 to name a few. and, in my opinion, the tl in terms of power, handling,  toyota , amenities, and over all luxury feel is in the ball park with all the  car  mentioned here. now, if price were not a consideration, would i choose the tl over a 5 series or  audi , probably not. but the tl is $10,000+ less comparably equipped. that is a huge advantage. another advantage to the tl that the others don't have is the sh-awd. when you take a corner hard in the tl, it almost defies physics as you can feel the outside wheels forcing the car into the turn. it is a un toyota ue feeling and makes for a fun drive. i also drove a buick  buick  and with the exception of a beautiful interior, the  buick  does not measure up to the tl in performance areas and is not the same type of car, more of a nice luxury sedan. regarding the rl, that is a dated design that needs a change. i assume the next gneration rl will be a step up in size and maybe power from the current tl to differentiate it. but who knows. again, the tl does compare well to the other  sedan . it is a tremendous value in this very competitive segment.

billyperks2,10-Aug," that's why i dont read those silly comparison test because it is just useless to the everyday driver. is anyone really going to be going 0-60 in 5 seconds on the highway? is anyone really braking at 114 ft from 0-60? is anyone doing 0.84g in a sloam with their  car ? unless you take the car over to skip barber race track, then these things become a reality.secondly, did they test the  bmw  manual 6spd and the audi manual against the tlawd? i am guessing they did. they need to test a 328xi automatic and audi automatic awd against the tl awd.

plekto,10-Aug," still, your best deal is to get a certified 2-3 year old model for $20k and actually own it at the end. doubly so with a manual, as they are extremely sought after in the used market and easy to sell.buy one with *only* the leather  seat  - or get them upgraded to real leather at a local shop for about the same price. every other option will break and/or cost a fortune to fix. a manual base model c class with only leather as an option is on my top 10 l toyota  along with  car  like a  infiniti  and a cts. you'll never regret owning it if you get one like this.

ivan_99,10-Aug, i'm in your corner with the tl over g.i wouldn't buy one for other reasons...but i'm one of the few that actually like the way it looks. in print (web) it looks odd...but in person i was impressed.kinda cool looks...bunch of buttons on the dash (tastefully done); exterior looks like a spaceship. it looks different...which is good; i get bored with the same ol (i like the x6  )got the sh-awd to over-steer (a bit) -- that was with the gas...not pulling the parking brake or anything like that  -- i wouldn't rate this drive train layout any less than the others.a little nose heavy; but not too bad...kinda like an audi (haven't driven the latest  audi ...)it's a bit too big for me (guess  acura  v6...); but of course my is350 feels big (probably because it's overweight).

marcus216,10-Aug," i respectfully disagree regarding performance of the tl against other premium performance  sedan . my neighbor has a 2009 bmw 535 ix and i have driven his car and he has driven mine. acceleration in a bit better in the bmw, but not much and my tl handles almost as well as his bmw. now, am i saying that the tl is a better performing car, no. but it is fairly close. so to say that the tl is better compared to a buick or lincoln than a 5 series is, in my opinion just not accurate.

jtla,10-Aug," certainly no need to trade in a 2008 for a 2010. they are still basically the same car. the point i was trying to make was that the g, especially the current model year, is not nearly as gasoline thirsty as some may think. "

2233,10-Aug," i guess you neglected to check the acura transmission problem section on edmunds.there are many posts about transmission and clutch  problem  in 2006 vehicles, not just 2005 and prior models.remember, it took several years before the transmission  problem  surfaced regarding the transmission failures of tls from 1999-2005. now the  problem  with the 2006 transmissions are surfacing. next year we may hear about  problem  from 2007.acura's customer service and care are terrible at the national level also.

smarty666,10-Aug," trust me, acura customer service is ten times better than anything i've gotten from both infiniti or nissan when i've had a issue, question, or warranty problem that needed to be addressed. acura at least pretends like they care, even if in the end, they can't help you out. nissan/infiniti on the other hand just flat out won't believe you and tells you anything wrong with your vehicle is normal. the customer service treatment i received from gm for almost 30 years was an abomination to say the least. acura might not be as high as caddy, jaguar, or lexus for customer service but trust me, there are much worse customer service from other companies out there! just remember, the population sample of edmunds reports is a small minority of the total owners who have acura vehicles and we don't here from the vast majority of acura owners on edmunds, only a small group, sometimes only a few hundred, out of the hundreds of thousands of acura owners. doesn't mean there isn't a problem, but you have to take the sample size of  problem  with a grain of salt and try not to paint a broad brush, as your trying to do, that all acura's are bad products. you can make this same point with any automakers and their specific  problem  you here complained and re toyota d here on edmunds and then paint a broad brush about the entire automaker and try to frighten people not to get those brands: gm: numerous power steering and airbag issues in various modelshonda: brake/rotor issues on several models toyota/lexus: acceleration, transmission, and safety issues nissan: early gen cvt issues bmw: numerous electrical/sensor issues that need to be fixed chrysler: various mechanical/safety issues across the boardinfiniti: hunting/pecking and communication issues with transmission/computeraudi: some mechanical/electrical gremlins in a more than avg chunk of its modelsthe l toyota  can go on and on for each automaker and the point is, you take your chances with anyone of them; it just depends on, what one gives you a slightly higher chance of not getting a problem model from that automaker i can tell you with having two acura's both 2006+ that i have had no  problem  or no sign of  problem  with my transmission and i don't know anyone personally with a honda or acura model that has or has had transmission issues; i belong to a few acura boards and the majority do not have transmission issues; i only have seen a few dozen over the years on those boards report transmission issues, not that they can't happen, but they are not happening left and right with every acura model and in the intensity your trying to portray it as!

smarty666,10-Aug," when i got my new  nissan  last year, the auto up features on the front windows did not work at all. after two visits to the nissan stealers and being told they worked fine and that it was my fault they wouldn't go up in the way i was pushing the button, i called nissan consumer affairs. i re toyota d the problem to them, and without even asking me any details, they too tried to blame me and say i was not pushing the button correctly. they then went behind my back, called the stealer where i took the car and then called me back saying they talked to the stealer and they couldn't find anything wrong. about a week went by and i did some of my own research online and found a tsb put out by nissan for the auto-up feature not working on the  nissan  and what needed to be done to correct it. printed out the tsb and took it into the stealer on the third trip, gave them the paper and threatened to get the stealership owner involved if they did not address the issue. suffice it to say, third time was the charm on such a ridiculously non-complicated issue that both the nissan stealer and nissan consumer affairs could have addressed but do to their idiotic and poor customer service i was dismissed and blamed for my warranty problem. doesn't get any worse then that. never have had acura stealer blame me for a warranty or issue on my vehicles yet.i've got 2 or 3 more issues i could describe but this specific one above is enough to illustrate my point. :shades: "
smarty666,10-Aug," you know why you didn't have any troubles with infiniti in regards to your brake and rotor issues, b/c i went through the same thing with them on my 2005  infiniti . every 10k miles, i had to have my brakes replaced and rotors resurfaced b/c how poorly they were made/grinded together. when ever i applied the brakes, i had this terrible grinding/shimmy through the pedals and wheels, which always indicated to me i was nearing the 10k mile mark for another infiniti stealer visit. luckily it was all covered under warranty which i never could understand b/c most automakers consider brake/rotor wear a normal wear and tear item which is not covered under warranty. come to find out, there were multiple class action lawsuits against infiniti for poor brake/rotor  problem  that people with early year  pontiac 5 and  infiniti /45 vehicles had. infiniti was not covering the brakes and rotor repairs even for people that had their brakes and rotors shot to hell after only 6-7k miles on them. enough people sued and infiniti was forced to settle and cover the brake and rotor repairs under warranty. it wasn't until infiniti was forced to do the right thing that they actually stepped up and did it! thats the reason why all those issues you had were covered under warranty at no cost to you. enough people had  problem  and sued to get that stuff covered. shame is, infiniti continued to put poor quality brake/rotors on their vehicles all the way up to 2008 models. i've only recently seen signs that the issues on their models have changed with a changed to better quality brake/rotors on their 2009+ models and the frequency and occurrence of brake/rotor issues has dropped d dodge atically since the change in parts in 2009!

2233,10-Aug," infiniti stepped up with me and replaced a second set of pads and rotors. the terms of the class action suit did not require this nor were they required to do anything on the 2007 infiniti. that is the difference between acura and infiniti in my experience. i am commenting only on my experiences with these 2 companies. iinfiniti has resolved their issues. has acura?if you checked my other posts re this issue, my extended family was about as loyal to acura/honda as anyone in this country. i owned a total of 8 honda/acuras, my parents owned 2, and my 3 brothers owned a total of about 10. my brother worked for enterprise car rental and purchased over 50  honda  from our local dealership.my driveway looked like a acura/honda dealership at thanksgiving. you would think that acura would be a little accomodating and pay for half of my transmission repair. it might have cost them $1,000.my brother is shopping for suvs as we speak and he has eliminated honda/acura in his search. i just bought an  nissan  friday for my daughter. my other brother is looking for a sedan and has also eliminated this brand.that's 3 lost sales in 3 weeks and more lost sales are forthcoming.good move acura.

tlong,10-Aug, is that transmission a manual or auto? i thought all the tranny failures for honda/acura were related to the auto. my 100k miles on my '05 acura tl is an automatic. the car has been rock solid from a reliability perspective. 
smarty666,10-Aug," i'd suggest you re-read the class action lawsuit b/c it does require them to replace the brakes and rotors on the opposite axle to the drive under warranty! since the  pontiac 5 and  infiniti  in my case, was rwd, this covered the front brakes/rotors. i had them replaced and resurfaced for free at 10k, 20k, 30k, and 40k. thats four times! when the rear brakes/rotors started having troubles at 20k, was told by two separate infiniti stealers that,   ""  kia hyundai oh, the rear's were not covered under the class action suit b/c the vehicles were rwd!  ""  kia hyundai  called infiniti headquarters who only confirmed what the stealers told me and despite all my  problem  with the fronts, even though i was still under warranty would do nothing to help pay for the rear brakes/rotors. yeah, great customer service! infiniti does not step up to the plate when it truly matters! that is why they are ranked at the bottom of the luxury customer service l toyota  by jd power! no matter what automaker, you shouldn't be having brake/rotor issues at those kind of low miles anyway if they are made and put together properly. what is sad is that infiniti could not step up to the plate until being legally forced to and actually had the nerve to tell 2003-2006  pontiac 5 and 2003-2006 fx owners that they had to pay out of pocket for brakes/rotors being shot at 7-10k miles as normal wear and tear!we used to have a lot of nissan/infiniti in my family, like you did with honda/acura and none so far have gone back to infiniti and replaced them with acura's, lexus's, and bmw's.

2233,10-Aug," smarty 666,my point was that infiniti made several repairs to our vehicles after the warranty expired and well after any mandate required them to do.acura did not. their refusal to equitably share in the repairs of the transmission occurred after we presented, in wiriting and in great detail, our documented complaints over 5 years on this transmission.this is my experience. yours may be different. it seems we are both   ""  kia hyundai car guys  ""  kia hyundai  with differing experiences who can engage in lively discussions but with different opinions.acura is clearly having sales  problem  with their tl. that is not in dispute. hopefully these discussion are read by them and they can return acura to their prior level of quality and desirability. hopefully acura, infiniti, bmw, et al read these posts and attempt to improve their transmissions, brakes, engines etc and provide better and safer  car  for their customers.loyalty is important to me and my extended family and it should run both ways. i'm sure you feel the same way.

Kirstie_H,10-Aug," mine has 106k on it, so i doubt anyone will cover anything under warranty. and, considering i haven't spent a dime on the vehicle in repairs (just maintenance, wear-and-tear items), the brake issue is relatively acceptable.it's not the reason i'm likely trading in, but the snow issue is. i used to live in a  chevrolet  area, with rest saturn nts, a bar, grocery store, and movie rental place less than 0.2 miles away - easy walking. now i live in a more country-like setting, with nothing in walking d toyota ance, and the roads in the area just aren't great, nor do they get plowed well. better tires would help, but not enough. 2 of our 3 vehicles don't go anywhere when it snows (both rwd), so i'm considering trading in before winter hits. last year was one of the 3 snowiest years on record here, so that's probably affecting my decision.mpgs aren't fantastic, but i currently do so little driving that it isn't a big deal.

pv2,10-Aug," since you have a manual transmission, your car probably came with summer performance tires which are useless in the snow. suggest you change to an all season performance tire. i have an '07 tl-s with auto, so it came with michelin hx-mxmv all season performance tires and they work well in anything under a 6 inch snowfall. the other alternative is to havea separate set of winter tires and rims, but that can be expensive. you'll be sacrificing a tiny bit of dry performance at the limit, but that shouldn't be a big issue unless you drive very aggressily. good luck.

fedlawman,10-Sep," i agree there are a lot of 3 series bmw's on the road, but i wouldn't call them overpriced. you can buy a  bmw  for less than you spent on your  acura .as for reliability and cost of repairs, i wouldn't say a bmw 3 series will cost any more to own than an acura. bmw's have their fair share of  problem , but acura isn't exactly known for their robust clutches, transmissions, or brakes. and let's not forget about poor paint quality, interior rattles, and failing radio/nav screens.

billyperks2,10-Sep, you have to be joking-unreliability and bmw are like peas in a pod.go check out the bmw forum- i think i saw one poster returning his 2011 5 series. 
smarty666,10-Sep," i agree, that bmw can be had a price similar to many acura models, but, and this is big but, at the same price, the bmw is lacking many features and technology the acura comes with at the same price. if you load up the 328 say with the same technology, features, and equipment that a tech package  acura  comes with, the bimmer is going to be a few thousands more. thats just the way it works out.   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  is the same way as bmw once loaded up with the same equipment, tech, etc as a loaded up acura is. they both are going to cost more. and people pay that by the droves, except for lexus, mb and bmw have the highest luxury sales b/c people flock to them because of their ridiculous prestige badge, despite having to spend more money to get that in their bmw or mb then for the same stuff in a acura, infiniti, or lexus for a few to several thousand dollars less.

bimmer4me,10-Sep, this can be  toyota d about all automobile manufactures one way or another...check out the 2011 hyundai forum. 
shipo,10-Sep," it's no joke. like it or not, believe it or not,  bmw  are typically very reliable over the long term. that the brand spanking new  bmw  has a very specific teething issue with the steering control software (which causes a pull to the right and has caused a number of folks to ask bmw to buy the car back) is a) not surprising given that it is a first year model, and  cannot be used as a metric to bolster your argument that  bmw  aren't reliable.fwiw, i've had two  bmw  and driven them for a combined 150,000 miles. the single unscheduled service event that i've ever had was a burned out taillight. sounds pretty reliable in my book.

(and no, i've never owned a mb). different people have different preferences. some might want reliability or more tech gadgets. others might want better leather or a more solid feeling or a better handling drive. there are real reasons why people pick things, not only for prestige. "
jimbres,10-Sep," i have an '01 bmw 330i that i bought new in june of that year. since the factory warranty ran out, in june 2005, i've spent a grand total of $1200 on unscheduled repairs. (most of that went toward replacing a control arm, after i drove into the biggest pothole on the east coast. can't really blame that on the car.)that works out to a little over $19 per month, or about 60 cents per day. i spend more than that on coffee.you'll find that the  bmw  is a very reliable car, particularly when it's equipped  honda ing to god's wishes - with a stick. "
billyperks2,10-Sep, agree. 
nyccarguy,10-Sep," about  bmw  being unreliable and expensive to fix/maintain is just plain absurd. not every car is perfect. for heaven's sake, my brother in law's  honda  just had to have the engine replaced after it overheated, oil started gushing out from underneath it, and ceased (he's fanatical about preventitive maintenance). should he go into the  honda  forum here on edmunds and say how unreliable they are.yes, acura gives you more bang for the buck if you are a tech guy. but the  acura  is cheaper because it is built on a fwd honda  honda  chassis. a 3 series is built on a dedicated rwd platform which is more expensive to build & design.yes some people buy  bmw , mbs, audis, lexuses, infinitis, acuras... for the badges, but there are many who do drive them because there is a noticable difference in the steering, the brakes, the handling, the responsiveness. "
smarty666,10-Sep," i wasn't trying to make it out that prestige was the only reason but in regards to bmw and mb, when they are similarly equipped/packaged to their acura, infiniti, or even audi counterparts are chosen a lot for the prestige factor for those thousands of dollars extra. for many, its not the only reason as you pointed out. for bmw, it could be for a combo of prestige and sport performance/ toyota mics as to why they chose their vehicle or say for a mb it could be a combo of prestige and luxury  toyota . personally, audi to me, has sales similar still to acura and infiniti in quantity but even audi is different from mb and bmw in that like the japanese, they have nicely priced trim levels that include a whole bunch of features so that you don't have to get really expensive option packages or pay extra for each luxury feature you want. but then again, you have the reliability factor with them so your right that there a huge set of factors, prestige being just one of them, to consider with each luxury automaker. i've found out recently over the years, customer service at the dealership and headquarter levels is coming into a sales factor for me because some of the companies are terrible where as others are great. "
sweendogy,10-Sep, from the sales numbers it doesn't look like many people are buying acuras at all- regardless of prestige factor you speak of. i think for 75% of these  car  (in this chat) bought new are traded in within 5 years so i think the reliability factor should be discounted-unless you are looking at used. most come with 4yr earrantee. most keep value well regardless of reliability in this group.i think if your looking to spend 40k on a car - you should compare what 40k buys you. a 40k bmw 335 is not going to give you the same options as a tl but will give you better performance. it's all what your looking for - performance or convenience. on a side note i think audi  audi 's are way overpriced for size and performance. 
roadburner,10-Sep," that works out to a little over $19 per month, or about 60 cents per day. i spend more than that on coffee. my 1995 3 series has 121,000 miles on it and the cost of scheduled maintenance and repairs(including four sets of summer/track ru toyota er) averages a bit under 5 cents per mile. as for my wife's 2004 x3 2.5, at 101,000 miles the sole unscheduled repair has been a bad passenger srs sensor- which was replaced under warranty. maintenance costs are again averaging @5 cents per mile, and that takes into account the fact that i change the oil and filter twice as often as the si system calls for. i better be looking for a good chapter 7 attorney... :p in contrast, my 2007  mazda peed 3 has 64,000 miles on it and it has needed a lf strut, a turbo dodge , and a vvt actuator- all before it hit 50,000 miles. "
smarty666,10-Sep," agree sween with most, but i was only talking about the prestige factor in regards to bmw, mb, and lexus, not acura. your right, acura sales have been pretty disappointing. if they didn't have the  acura  or  acura  they would be in really bad shape. now that we know they are keeping the rl, they need to  ford  on that and do a complete overhaul on the thing. its killing them right now.

billyperks2,10-Sep," i saw some pics of the new one, i am not sure if its going to make production.point is- a five year old  honda  will blow the doors off a 335xi. "
shipo,10-Sep," let's see here, forgetting for a moment that the  honda  in 2005 cost well over twice the price of a 2011  bmw , comparing a purpose built two-seat sports car to a four-door family/sports sedan isn't a terribly relevant exercise. that  toyota d, my bet is that a 2011  bmw  sp will take it to the  honda  on any number of tracks, maybe even the majority of tracks. i mean geez, a couple of years ago honda sponsored a race on a tight road course in japan to compare their various performance  car , and a jdm  honda  si gave the  honda  all it could handle. in the end, the  honda  would run away on the straights and the  honda  would just reel it back in on the tw toyota y bits.

smarty666,10-Sep," if you had read the second post i put up, i  toyota d prestige was not the sole and only factor but it has a lot to do with the bmw and mb choices. if you don't think so then your just kidding yourself and if you looked closely at what i was comparing and talking about it was vehicles that were comparably equipped between the german and japanese automakers. that means, same size engines, features, technology, etc. the germans are always going to cost a few thousand more. it is more a statement of fact then opinion. that is just the way it is. your absolutely right that acura currently has lacked in the hardcore sport performance offerings of rwd and v8 but not every body needs that. i certainly have no issues with performance out of my 3g tl's but not everyone is so happy and wants more. if you want sport performance with a v8 and rwd go get a bmw or infiniti, plain and simple. that is why there are choices in the luxury market.

smarty666,10-Sep, infiniti knows that as well so i would assume there will be incentives on the  infiniti  bringing a fully loaded one to be less than a  infiniti  once incentives are applied to that vehicle. i don't think infiniti is stupid enough to charge full msrp on a  infiniti  when a  infiniti  with incentives costs just about the same. i think the range of prices is $30-$34 thousand. it will be interesting to see how many loaded ones will be on the lots compared to mid-level trims.

edwardsf,10-Sep," yes, performance wise, the g and the 3 series seemed much better to me than the rest. i did not test the higher end 335, is350, c350 or tlawd as they seemed a bit pricey to me and the gas mileage on all, except the 335 was pretty bad. i don't need awd. so we all have our own needs, which puts us into different markets. i had never thought about it before but the tl drivers do seem to be a bit combative. i think this thread has a huge tl vs. g battle in past years. i actually like both  car  (i considered both in 2 car purchases) and think that many people would be happy with either. i think the g and 3 series are a little more engaging to drive but every once in a while, i pine for a slightly smoother car - maybe like a tl or c300. i never pine for a gm, suzuki or toyota....

smarty666,10-Oct, can't argue with any of that!  
smarty666,10-Oct," i would agree with you on points 1 and 2 for the most part but not on 3, 4, and 5. there are japanese offerings from at least 1 of the 3 companies that can match the germans in points 3, 4, and 5. lexus definitely has the prestige factor or so many people would not flock to them month after month for most of their products have such souless driving. i feel the same way about mb but they do a little bit better job of not making the drive as boring as lexus does but do not come close to audi, infiniti, or bmw when it comes to driving  toyota mics and sport performance. infiniti gives passion for the driver, but if you have never had one you would not know that. i've raced many bmw's in my time with my infiniti and have beaten many of them. its a really fun to drive and i smile a lot when in it so there are japanese vehicles that offer that passion and fun factor for the driver. in regards to point 3, infiniti has really nice looking vehicles, tight bodies, and many sporty curves to them. bmw used to really lack in this area until the new 3 and 5 series which finally have some nice curves in their body styles and i quite like the looks of both of them now on the outside. audi's body styles are really nice as well. in regards to point 4, the only german make who has a gorgeous interior is audi. bmw is still on the plain side with little textures, color in their interiors and just are functional. luckily they use high quality materials and little plastic which helps the blahness and makes the interior's livable and presentable. mb is using too much plastic like acura does now on the interiors which is disappointing and a turn off for me. the new m from infiniti has a really nice textured/high quality interior which competes finally on par with the germans. lexus has nice/high quality interiors as well depending on the model you get. there are plenty of japanese vehicles that are for people who love to drive to any points in style, you just don't care to look for them. talk about a rash generalization.

plekto,10-Oct," there are a few exceptions from time to time, though. the is300, for instance, was awesome when it was released. the is250/350 somehow lost that   ""  kia hyundai euro  ""  kia hyundai  feel and magic to it. i think it's more than just designing a car to handle well. i think it's that bmw and   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  know how to balance all of the factors so that none of them really stand out. ie - you get a solid b+ rating in everything and so it feels poised and has the same feel to it.a good analogy is a band. if one instrument stands out badly , it kind of ruins the thing. japan usually gets only a couple of areas wrong, and sometimes manages this balancing act. gm -well, they're lucky if the band is in tune most days. :p "

smarty666,10-Oct, perhaps but they don't use enough high quality materials like bmw and audi do cons toyota ently throughout the cabin. i've found way to many cheap imitation plastic things in their vehicles when i test drove them which bothered me a lot. i've seen two or three reviews over the last few years slapping them a little bit on the amount of plastic as well. though the leather was really nice quality and  toyota able i'll give mb that! 
fedlawman,10-Oct," plekto is right.the is300 is a good example of a fine effort by lexus to build a bmw. for the most part, they did a good job - in-line 6, 5 speed mt, fun to drive, and sporty inside. at the same time, they missed a few little things that held the car back from becoming a hit with enthusiasts - the interior was cheap and gimmicky (chronograph instruments), it wasn't as quick as a comparable bmw 330i, and it was nose heavy.of course, the biggest problem with the is300 was sales. it didn't appeal to lexus shoppers. it wasn't quiet, luxurious, or elegant so it didn't sell well.a couple other opinions:gm makes the cadillac cts, which by all accounts is a fine car in this class. it compares well to any car in this category, and does well because it doesn't try to be all things to all people. it is what it is, and it's proud of that.infinity is the closest japan gets to building a bmw in this class, but it lacks many of the things that bmw buyers want - a smooth and refined driveline being at the top of the l toyota . i also think it's wheelbase is too long and it's too heavy.kind of off-topic, but the best recent examples of japanese sports  car  are the dearly departed honda s2000 and the mazda miata and  mazda . these  car  are/were fantastic because they aren't trying to beat bmw or be a   ""  kia hyundai japanese bmw contender.

smarty666,10-Oct," it is my hope that the lack of manual, nav, and a few other things on the  infiniti  was done intentionally by infiniti b/c they really are just using the 25 right now to test the entry-lux level for it and see how it does. all those features it lacks would jack the price up on the  infiniti  further making it compete in the  infiniti  territory of price which would be just plain ridiculous. remember, this generation g is coming to an end hopefully at the end of next year since 2011 is the fifth model year now, and it will be due for a redesign across the board for 2012.it's my hope that if the  infiniti  sells okay for infiniti that when they go to redo the 3g g-sedan they will completely redo/rethink the  infiniti  and add these features and maybe even make a totally different body style for it from the high trim g sedan. this is just speculation of course though.

nyccarguy,10-Oct," for different folks.every single one of these  car  has pluses and minuses to different people. for the longest time i've actually favored handling and driving  toyota mics over raw power and torque.maybe i'm getting older & the fact that i live in ct where the entrance  dodge ps on the merrit parkway are short and have stop signs at the beginning of them has something to do with it. my 2001 honda  honda  type sh handles brilliantly. however, its 200 horsepower @ 7000 rpm (7500 rpm redline), 156 lb/ft of torque @ 5250 rpm, & almost 128,000 miles just doesn't quite cut the mustard anymore. even my wife's 4cyl  acura  feels like it has more pickup. i'm not in the market now because i just bought a house and a second car payment is out of the question right now. plus i think we're going to try and ditch the  acura  next year to get wifey an suv of some sort (she misses her '07 x3).so if she gets an suv, then my next ride doesn't have to be huge. just as long as it has latches for the car  seat  so i can take my boys somewhere without stranding wifey without a car (she can drive stick, but hasn't in years). in my new home,i'll be putting over 21,000 miles per year on a car just commuting.i believe with the modern electronic nannies (traction control, stability control, abs), i can rock a rwd sport sedan through our winters with a dedicated set of snow tires (as i do with my  honda ).the  infiniti s is priced right, has gobs of power, and i'm really impressed with how it handles. i've only driven an awd  infiniti x, so i can only imagine how well the s handles. bmw  are not cheap to buy. 3 series are everywhere you turn. i love the way the e90 3 series drives, rides, handles, brakes. i've only owned new  car  in my life since i passed my driving test at 16 (i'm only 34 now), but i will totally consider a cpo n55 powered  bmw  in the future.like i  toyota d before, the lexus is350 appeals to me. i like the styling, the interior is very well finished i'm sure, they now offer an f sport version of the is which i'm sure sharpens the handling. i went to lexus and built one, it isn't as expensive as i once thought. but no stick shift available on the is350 kills me. i know there is a stick offered on the is250, but that car has the pickup of a  toyota . at least the slushbox awd version i drove did. the brakes are impossible to modulate. there is no way the steering is as sharp as the 3 series. i keep my  car  for a while. going on 9 years with my '01  honda  (bought new as a leftover in april '02). we'll see what happens when the time comes.

ivan_99,10-Oct, what kind of mileage do you get? i had an 03  pontiac 5 and would see about 21mpg or so. this was mostly highway (70-80%).at the time i thought it was fine...but today... with  hyundai 's putting out more power than my g did back then (especially with the old hp rating system) and getting in the 30's mpg...my expectations have increased. 
smarty666,10-Oct," no, i didn't say they were ending the g they will be due for a redesign on the g model since 2011 is the 5th model year of the 2g. i wouldn't get so hung up on the lack of manual at this point. like the article says, there is no demand for the manual and infiniti even has trouble selling them in the  infiniti  so most are not going to want the manual in a  infiniti  and they might have some cost issues with at least offering. the  acura  does not offer a manual and you don't see its sales tanking. yes the option is nice to have but infiniti might have the lack of it as an excuse to force people to get the more expensive  infiniti  as a sales ploy so you never know. maybe in the future they will make it an order only option.the 3g g models are just around the corner and i'm eagerly anticipating what infiniti is going to do to their best selling vehicle. i'm interested to see what influence mb is going to have on the next gen g engine since nissan/infiniti is now in a co-op partnership with diamler and they are suppose to be sharing things between divisions!

smarty666,10-Oct," well i can't speak for when, how, and what kind of vehicle you have, but i know from multiple bad winter storms here in nj over the years, that with my fx, i was all over the road with just the rwd. i tried driving numerous times without the awd and ii was scared for my life. even doing 10-20mph below speed limit and being extremely careful the wheels would spin out. once i engaged awd the vehicle felt planted to the road and i stopped spinning out and having difficulties controlling the vehicle. everything i read to this day still says awd is the preferable option for winter weather traveling and i concur with my own personal experience.to me, there is usally only a 1-2 mpg difference between awd and rwd so mise well not take the chance and sacrifice a little mpg. personally, i like that infiniti has awd option and not awd all the time like subaru and others. this way, 85% of the year i can use just the rwd with better fuel economy and just use awd when i need it specifically. if there is ice on the road forget awd or any drive for that matter. when there is ice on the ground nothing can help you.

jimbres,10-Oct," shipo's point is that with the right tires - dedicated winter tires - one can safely drive an rwd car on snow-covered roads. did you switch to dedicated winter tires, or were you using all-season tires when you tried to drive in rwd mode in snowy conditions?if the latter, then you really weren't addressing shipo's point.

mz6greyghost,10-Oct," being from upstate ny, i can mostly agree with the amount of awd models on the local lots, but there are still rwd models available, without having to special-order them (and they're not only base models with no options either).as far as winter tires are concerned, granted each area has a different climate, but when you live in an area that averages over 150  ""  kia hyundai  of snow per year, and when it can fall at rates of 4-6  ""  kia hyundai  per hour, winter tires are a must. i lose count of how many different awd vehicles (suvs,  car , etc.) that end up being buried in a roadside ditch simply because their all-seasons can't keep up with the conditions. people tend to forget that awd only helps with acceleration, but does nothing in terms of steering or stopping on slippery roads. given a choice, i'd take a vehicle with winter tires over any awd vehicle with all-season tires, no matter which set of wheels are actually attached to the drivetrain.and iirc, there are some local dealers that actually store the winter tires/wheels for you when they're not needed, and will swap out the 3-season wheels/tires and store them in the winter months (for a fee, of course!)

shipo,10-Oct," a point you might be missing is (for lack of a better phrase), not all snow, sleet and even ice is created equal. there are plenty of winter conditions where dedicated winter tires will find a fair amount of traction where even the best all-season tires will find virtually none. "

plekto,10-Oct," does it have to be new? i have several that i'd recommend if you are willing to consider something a couple of years old, like a 2008 cts. 20k, give or take, and just about perfect for your needs.i guarantee that it's not   ""  kia hyundai american  ""  kia hyundai  in how it's designed or drives. probably the only thing that gm has for sale now, in fact, that is like that. my second recommendation is actually also from gm, but you'd have to get a 2009 model, because gm stopped importing it to the u.s. then. go test drive a pontiac  pontiac /holden commodore. it's a fantastic vehicle and is no problem to find one for less than 20k, certified. if you want something that handles well, is rwd, has a nice interior, and is a total sleeper/under everyone's radar, while being one size larger than a  infiniti  - without the silly price tag, look no further.i personally like it more than the current cts. i'm still incredibly shocked that gm took it's #1 selling passenger car in australia(and best imo, that they currently make worldwide) and stopped importing it to the u.s. such an incredibly idiotic move. but you can get one used. change the badges if you wish.  note - it's also sold outside the u.s. as the new  chevrolet   chevrolet . so at least there's some hope of it returning next year or so.these two are the only options from gm that will satisfy you if you like how the tl and infiniti and so on drive. everything else, yes, it's a toad and should be avoided. but do check these out - you might be able to get a used/certified car and own it for only a little more than the payments on a lease of something like a 3 series.

ivan_99,10-Oct," i'm assuming your requirements are similar to your 08 tl i.e. you're ok with fwd...don't need super sport suspension tunning.you want space...more than an is...something around a 5 series (if the price was right).you could almost l toyota  all manufacturers and they'd each have an offering in this segment.you mentioned that you're apprehensive about audi reliability. since you lease are you concerned about being stranded and/or inconvenienced with repairs? i'd take a look at the domestics as well (i actually liked the cts...coupe looks very nice too)...go drive a cts,  buick , sho...even go drive an  lincoln  and see...of course if you 'know' you're not going to buy one then i suppose you're just wa toyota ing your time (i was surprised).if you're not keen on domestics how about the european? c350 is very nice,  volvo  looks nice (never drove)...might be small if a 5 series is your size requirement.at this point, for me, i'd lean more towards a new  audi  2.0t...does everything well, looks real elegant and has good mileage.i liked the new tl as well (i also like the looks  ) ...it wasn't too large and the sh-awd let me over-steer the back end out a bit...so that was pleasant. plus you'd get your space requirements (guess  nissan  has similar specs too).new infiniti  bmw 7?you may also lean towards the vehicles with the 'included maintenance' as well... "
igozoomzoom,10-Oct," it's painful for me to admit, but the beak on the current tl is the most hideous thing i've ever seen! this is coming from someone who still can remember my first time driving my cousin's brand new 1986 acura  acura  (dark blue with gray lower  hyundai ) and realizing that it was the most special car i'd ever driven. i later owned a 1994 acura  acura  gs that was the love of my life until it was demolished by a drunk jerk driving a huge 4x4- but it saved my life. i also owned a 2002 tl type-s that was a spectacular car in every way...until the transmission went out at 32k miles and then again after another 20k miles...i didn't want to own it if/when the third transmission failed if it was out of warranty, so i had to get rid of it. suffice it to say, i've been an acura-phile from the very beginning in late 1985...but the newest designs range from bland to downright vulgar (tl)....the  acura  seems to suffer the least from this design 'theme'?have you considered the  acura  v6 as a possible replacement for your '08 tl-s? it is less than an one-inch +/- in front and rear head, leg and hip room compared to your tl. overall passenger volume is 94 cu ft vs. 98 cu ft for your tl, so it's only very slightly smaller. interior cargo (luggage) volume is virtually identical at 12.6 vs. 12.5 cu ft. the infiniti  infiniti s is almost identical in every interior measurement (head/leg/hip room) to your tl, with 99 cu ft of passenger volume and 13.5 cu ft cargo volume. so it's not smaller in any way than the tl, but the interior design or other design aspects may may it 'seem' to be...i'd give it another look before ruling it out! if you are leasing, would the larger infiniti  bmw 7 also be within the realm of possibilities? it has a boost in headroom and legroom in front and rear compared to the tl. total passener volume is 104 cubic feet and cargo volume is 14.9 cu ft. not sure if i like it any better than the  infiniti s, but it might be something to consider....and one other wild card that i will recommend, if a luxury 'brand' isn't esssential and you're just wanting a car that looks and performs in the same realm with most entry-level performance/luxury models- the 2011 mazd audi  s grand touring 4-door. the current 2010 is a very impressive vehicle, with exceptional handling and plenty of power any time you need it! the 3.7l v6 only has a 272hp rating, but it has 269lb-ft of torque (matching the torque figures for the 330hp  bmw 7 and exceeding all the other  car  discussed above, despite their 280-328hp ratings). it also hits that torque peak at 4250rpm, compared to 5200rpm in both infinitis.the only two options on the 2010 mz6 s grand touring are voice-activated navigation and the technology package. the tech package adds advanced keyeless entry & start with push-button starting, sirius sat radio, led tail lights, fully automatic bi-xenon hid headlamps, power passenger seat and rain-sensing wipers. with those two options, it is a very close match for the  infiniti s, feature-for-feature but for $6-7k less! the 2011 model is getting a 'refresh' that willl only make the car more attractive and upscale in look and feel. it's worth a visit to the mazda dealer one day, just to experience the car for yourself. my best friend and i took one for a test drive two weekends ago and he wasn't even in the market for a new car....but he traded his 2008 is 250 on the spot for it! =) "
smarty666,10-Oct," i can definitely feel you about the new tl. i have a 08 as well and the new one is such a turn off on the exterior for me its not even funny. if you think the  infiniti  is small then i would not recommend a 3 series or    mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz   since they are even smaller on the inside. i would recommend a caddy cts or like other's have mentioned the new  nissan . if your looking for the true sport sedan feel you won't get that completely with the max due to the cvt/fwd but it definitely has got a more sport oriented handling and power. i ended up with one b/c like you did not want a  infiniti  due to the c dodge ped feeling when in it. the max has plenty of room, pretty sporty body style, and you get certain features you normally can only get in luxury  sedan  if you get the premium packages. the leasing and financing for it are excellent and many people are getting fully loaded ones for $34-35k. if that doesn't fit your bill, i would check out the  hyundai  but again, some people don't like the hyundai name plate. not sure what budget or finances are for your but if possible, i would check out the new m and 5 series as well. they are definitely going to fit your bill when it comes to size and features but you will pay more for them obviously. best of luck!!!

dap2006,10-Oct," great post! gave me some things to think about. i haven't been an acura fan as long as you but i had a 92  honda  that i loved and kept 12 years - i got a 2006 tl after that and then my current tl-s. i had driven the  bmw  before i got the tl-s and loved the drive - almost pulled the trigger but my wife had loved the honda/acura's (2 previous  honda 's) so i caved and i went with my current ride (which is nice, don't get me wrong).i'm not a mazda fan but i'll take a look at the mz6 to see what it looks like. i can't see me driving a    mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  , though - too much coin for what you get. so far i'm thinking the audi  audi /s4,  infiniti s and  bmw 7 seem the likely suspects... :shades: :shades: "
ivan_99,10-Oct, i loved the mazd audi  v6 as well...in the manual-auto mode i had it in 1st gear at around 4k rpm -- just going down the street. i hammered it and chirped the tires into 2nd gear.not really a marketable feature...or even worthy of purchasing it for (since it is very good overall). but a very powerful v6. rear seat room is huge too.loved the manual in the mazda 6...too bad it only was on the 4cylnot much love for the mazda 6...don't see many.same as the  volkswagen  cc -- don't see many. i actually prefer the cc over many in this thread. 
plekto,10-Oct," i will mention, though, that the new cts is worlds better than anything mazda makes. it's positioned in europe as a bmw 5 series competitor at a lot less money. my parents just went through this exact same scenario. and had it down to the same models are you are looking at. and the cts just simply was a superior product to the infiniti. the only vehicle that gave it serious competition was the c300, which is my #1 pick if money is no object. it;s everything that you want and   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  is apparently finally making their  car  right again. though currently only the c class is benefiting, as will the upcoming model e class(it takes time to re-tool and phase in new technology)also, i mentioned the  pontiac  because while 2009 was the last year for it, it had the same suspension and engine as a cts. it's a worlds better choice than the  buick  and actually is fairly attractive by comparison(looks like a cross between the cts and the  buick , imo - slightly rounded but not a jellybean.but let's look at the math on slightly used vs lease:first off, infiniti has no financing options currently on 2011 models. (it's impossible to find a 2010 to lease at this point). fail.let's look at acura, then. oops. same deal.k...   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz .   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  always runs leases(as does  volkswagen  and audi) c300 $349/month for 27 months. 10k/yr. $3141at signing.total at lease end: 12215 in payments. $452.41/month.(a bmw  bmw  is $439/month with 0 down at signing for reference)let's have some fun, then. 2011  honda  ex. $229 /month for 36 months. $1499 at signing. total at lease end: 9743 in payments. $270.64/month.now why would i do this comparison? because to lease any vehicle, you have to factor in what it costs versus a used model that still has the same amount of factory warranty left. 36 months lease vs 36 months(or more) warranty. now, the main deal here is the drive train, which is pretty much all that matters(most certified  car  get an extension anyways and the gremlins have been worked out/fixed. it's basically a wash, imo, since a 2 year old car won't break anyways unless it's something nasty like a suzuki or daewoo. i did a 2 minute search for a 2009  pontiac  with low mileage and under $25k.http://www.autotrader.com/fyc/vdp.jsp?ct=c&car_id=279792030figure $22k now and $12k in three years. that's $10k for three years. i put the  honda  in as a comparison because what this means is that you can get a certified year old vehicle and run it for three years for the same price as an economy car lease.but there's no wear and tear adjustment, no money factor idiocy or other tricks, no mileage cap or penalty. in short, you can own and decide to keep to trade whenever you want for the same price as a lease. the only difference is the payment structure per month. but a 72 month payment plan will usually net (now due to silly low interest rates) about the same monthly payment as a lease. if you want out of it, or to buy it at the end of the   ""  kia hyundai payments  ""  kia hyundai , it's a clear win. keep paying the bank or just sell it and end up with 0 month owed after 36 months.i get about $350 a month in this scenario vs $450 a month for the   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  or bmw. note - you can get a 2008 cts for about ~25k and the money works out the same as the cts depreciates a bit less - ~15k at 6 years old. the only difference is $400 a month and the same $10k total cost.let some other person eat the 10-15k initial depreciation. never buy new.

alltorque,10-Oct," i will mention, though, that the new cts is worlds better than anything mazda makes. it's positioned in europe as a bmw 5 series competitor at a lot less money. here in uk, the bmw 5's run from ?31k for the 523i se to around ?50k for the 550i se, with lots of diesels. the cadillac cts runs from ?27k for the 2.8 v6 thro' ?30k for the 3.6 v6 to ?56k for the 6.2 v8, (though who would buy that beats me). cts is generally compared unfavourably to bmw/merc/jag/audi due to poor ride/handling, (our roads aren't great), and having no diesel options..............a very big points loser !not sure i've ever seen one on the road.the mazda 6 runs from ?16k for the 1.8 s through to ?23k for the 2.2d sport estate, (wagon). gets rated highly, for price, if a tad noisy and there are lots of diesels.

edwardsf,10-Nov," re: the acceleration, i think it is called salesman ignorance, not bsregarding the turbolag in the  audi , i think it is not the awd but is the lousy cvt audi puts in the fwd  audi . the cvt improves gas mileage but acceleration suffers. (i liked the cvt in the  nissan .) i test drove several 2010  audi s with and without the cvt and there is a huge difference between the cvt and the tiptronic in the  audi  - the tip it is much smoother and seems faster. i had a 2007  audi   audi , which had a little more turbo lag - the 2010 is much smoother and almost eliminates turbo lag. that  toyota d, turbo lag ain't all bad because it means you get turbo acceleration. as fun and fast as my  bmw t is, it does not give the whoosh that the torque in the  audi  gives in 40-60 mph. i am an odd creature in that i love audis (and swedish saabs) but don't own one. i own a bimmer because it is quieter and i have a hearing problem. both are vunderval!  car . the  audi  is prettier, with more luxurious leather and a smoother, more refined driving feel. the 328 handles better, is faster throughout the mph range and is more reliable. the 335, of course, is faster but much more expensive and has a lousy repair record. regarding size, the  bmw  (sedan) is a bit c dodge ped but the it (sportwagon) has about the same amount of interior space as the  audi  sedan and wagon. or, how about a used 528 or 535? if you get a 2009, you get 4 years of warranty - 2 years of original warranty and two years of cpo. you eliminate those first two years of huge depreciation if you bargain well.  car .com has a 2009 in l.a. with 13k for $36,000. you could get it for $31,000. other thoughts - try the new volvo  volvo . it looks very cool and is very fast. new jags are gorgeous. dap, you are right: the  infiniti  is c dodge ped. the c300 is c dodge ped. the is250 is like a 70s band - superc dodge ped. the tl does have a nasty beak and is sorta ponderous. the  acura  is downscale from these  car  but still a cool rig. the cts - despite what pletko thinks - is an american car.

Kirstie_H,10-Nov," you seem to have a pretty good idea of your wants & needs, and that's great. i'm sure you'll end up with what's right for you. the only aspect of leasing vs. buying cpo for *me* is that i can get a used g-series with a shorter (than 5 year) term loan and the payment on that is about the same as a lease payment (assuming there are up-front costs associated with the lease), and after 3 yrs or so, i own the vehicle and can use the trade-in value on a new vehicle. something to thing about and research, but in the end you should just do what you can afford and what makes you happiest! "
plekto,10-Nov," i could have sworn that i also pointed that out before as well. :p why lease when you can own it for the same money a year or two older? everyone that i know who has done this instead has had a lot less stress and worries as well, because there's no issues with mileage, wear, or other idiocy that they make you go through with a typical lease. and the interest rates are often quite a bit better on a car loan versus a lease when you crunch the numbers.the  car  you are looking at are fine, really - i happen to like the cts. but that's literally the only gm or ford car that i can stand - i'm certainly no fan and would buy a   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  or similar in a heartbeat over anything else they make. i've owned a (used) s class in the past and the domestics have a long way to reach that level. for the first three months i'd constantly be  honda d just getitng into it and playing with the options. - there was a literal chasm between my previous buick and the   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz . it died - sad story there. then i got a 4x4 two other  car  to look at would be the e class and the lexus gs350. these depreciate quickly and are two excellent   ""  kia hyundai hidden gems  ""  kia hyundai  in the cpo world. a 2007 gs 350 should run you about 25k and a 2009 e class (built on the new more reliable c class platform, but stretched) should be about 30k. kia lly, 4 years old is the sweet spot between age and pricing, but the e class came out in 2009. the 2008 and earlier models were a disaster to keep running by comparison.iirc,   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  also has new car financing (1.9%) and leases on cpo models from time to time.(yes, lease a cpo used car - c class payments on a e class) lexus might have changed to this as well in reaction - you'd have to check for specifics.edit - they do have 1.9% for 48 months on cpo c class models right now - it's going to be hard to beat that price-wise. the new/better body style started in 2008. imo, the rear  seat  in the new c class are roomier than in the  infiniti . the pano dodge ic sunroof is incredible as well. "
Kirstie_H,10-Nov," well, you do get the full warranty in force for (usually) the duration of ownership if you lease. i can understand why that would be attractive. and, if you consider trading in to be a hassle that is just not worth the effort, there's another reason.i wouldn't lease, but i can understand why some people do.

edwardsf,10-Nov," i just finished a lease and much prefer my current option of owning a cpo. kirstie is right; there is some pressure in having a leased car as you are afraid every ding or tear will be costly. also, i never felt it was my car ('because it wasn't,' someone will say ; - ). but leasing a cpo is an interesting idea - no depreciation and you get frequency of change btw, i think the bmw cpo is not quite as good as you have it described. when the new car warranty ends the cpo begins. it is consecutive, not cumulative. so, if you have 50k and 2years when you buy a cpo car, the new car warranty ended at 50k. so you only get 2 years or 40k miles of cpo - whatever is less.  i think you pay $50 when you take it in for cpo repairs. also, the cpo also excludes a few items that are covered in the new car. still, for $22,000 off the mrsp of a car with no model changes, i will take it.

nyccarguy,10-Nov," cpo  car  are a great way to   ""  kia hyundai save  ""  kia hyundai  money in this ultra competitive entry level luxury performance sedan segment. you still have to do some digging & not just take the dealer's word for it as all cpos are not created equal. some dealers look at the car with a more finely tuned microscope than others. check into the service records. is it a local car serviced by the selling dealership or was it bought at a company auction? one poster on the x3 board (from az i think) test drove a cpo x3 that he felt wasn' up to snuff. something about the back window regualtors being faulty, he ended up buying the x3 in ca i think. you still are buying a used car.from a   ""  kia hyundai deal  ""  kia hyundai  standpoint, leasing a cpo car doesn't make sense. for the simple reason that no 2 cpo  car  are alike. the dealer can set their own lease rates & money factors. it isn't like leasing new where there is a november prog dodge  and the lease rate on every 2011  bmw  w/ x drive sedan is 0.xxxx or residual is xx%. there are just way too many v honda bles that the dealer controls that you as a consumer don't have access to. even the asking prices are arbitrary. you could negotiate a fantastic deal of $5k off, and then they jack up the lease rate and say the bank set a low residual.free scheduled maintenance is a crucial sticking point that makes bmw stand out. yes were are all smart enough that it is built into the car and it isn't technically free. but however they do it, it makes sense. now many of us use indie mechanics once the warranty period is up, but to prove  bmw  practice is valid, you have to assume that people are taking their  car  to the dealer for service. bmw  1st service comes at around 15k miles. gets you an oil change.now my wife has a 2010 acura  acura . i had the oil & filter changed at 4500 miles (synthetic), even though the service advisor begged me to wait until the light goes one (10,000 miles). i think it was a little over $100 with a tire rotation.service #2 which is technically the 1st service is what i did at 4500 miles $100+.i did at 10,000 miles.service #3 i did at 20,000 miles and i specifically instructed them to only do synthetic oil,filter, & tire roatation.many of acura's   ""  kia hyundai services  ""  kia hyundai  they offer are nothing more than visual checks of belts, hoses,lights... along with the oil change & tire rotation probably cost a few hundred dollars.bmw's 2nd service is an inspection i service which is a major service at around 30k miles.sometime after the 2nd service you are going to need brakes and rotors on your 3 series. at least the fronts. my parents had to have this done on my mom's '08 328xi also right after the odometer  toyota d 50k and it was $700. they also recently had an inspection ii done (out of warranty) and the car needed rear brakes - $900.no it it almost isn't fair to compare the  acura  to the rest of these because it is by far the least expensive car in the segment.but take your run of the mill car that's sitting on the luxury dealer's lot which in ct/ny/nj means awd, automatic, premium pkg, cold weather pkg, nav and the sticker prices( bmw  w/ x drive, c300 sport 4 matic, is250 awd, cts4,  audi  2.0t premium,  infiniti x) can't be that far off, so you definitely have to factor in free maintenance into the equasion. the msrps on all these  car  are north of $40,000.

nyccarguy,10-Nov," cpo  car  are definitely worth mentioning in this discussion. there are a lot of these entry level luxury performance  sedan  that are leased for whatever the reason. there is a school of thought out there that these  car  (especially european makes, totally unfounded btw)   ""  kia hyundai turn into pumpkins  ""  kia hyundai  once the twarranty runs out. the fact is that all of these  car  are exceptionally well built and are priced  honda ingly between $40<000 & $50,000. my experience with the '01  honda  (130k miles) leads me to believe that these (and most modern)  car  will run well past 50k miles with no major  problem  as long as you maintain them.i've only bought new since my 16th birthday, but i'd strongly consider a used 3 or g as my next ride. payments on a high $20k car are a lot easier to swallow than on a $40- $50k car.

smarty666,10-Nov," i tend to agree with you about cpo, especially with the germans, since they don't retain their resale value as well as the japanese, by getting cpo with them, your not taking the brunt of the depreciation like the original owner has. only disadvantage to cpo is that most, not all, but most of the cpo's i see on the luxury lots you have no idea how the previous owner took care of it (what kind of oil did they use, tires rotated properly, cleaned interior regularly, etc). i've found most do nothing to keep up the leather and vinyl interiors and they look like utter crap at only the 2 or 3 year mark when they are back on the lot as cpo and then you have a pain in the butt time trying to undo the neglect the first owner did. the stealers did little as possible to really clean up the car for used sales again, especially on the interior. but from a value proportion, money, and just to be in a luxury name, i can definitely see the attraction to cpo!

sweendogy,10-Nov," smarty i would of guessed the germans (certainly bmw) would keep values-- i mean they lease more  bmw  then other  car  in the group (my guess is the tl is prob second on the lease vs buy l toyota ) and the main reason is resale value-- prob part of the reason why bmw offered free oilchanges and other things to get people to lease a car that costs over 45k..plus bmw could sell a 3 year old 3 series for over 30k. i would dissagree with you on your cpo diss- the cpo report includes past maintenance -(btw is this the same lot you talked about hyundai, in the tl chat?) and if a car is certified i would wonder why bmw/audi/ infiniti would sell a car that was not properly cared for..certainly with whats going on with toyota and if there is data to say the car was not up to certification-- you think they want bad press for including a car that has not infact passed the 150 pt inspection. your talking about a 3 year old car that has less then 40k miles on it-- how bad is the leather?? does it have rips?? how they cared for it--come on -- if it has a rip the dealer fixes it. i have no idea where you are looking at cpo's (the same hyundai dealer ?)-- but you should look to see what reports on each car are avail before making such comments on   ""  kia hyundai most  ""  kia hyundai  cpos..value yes -- lux name yes-- attraction yes.-- :shades: "

smarty666,10-Nov," you need to do more readings on resale values, the japanese have always had a edge over that then the germans; there is nothing wrong with that, heck the germans retain value better than the american brand still so its all good whether you go japanese or german in regards to resale value and depreciation. check out alg website for the residual value awards and you'll see acura tops the l toyota  for the last 2 or 3 years i believe, several other sites l toyota  acura as top for resale value followed closely by lexus and infiniti. i hate to break it to you but cpo does not include past maintenance; i've returned plenty of lease vehicles from different manufacturers over the years who did not even care to see my maintenance records so there is no possible way for them to know, when they act like that at lease return, how the car was maintained and i'm sorry, but i've seen plenty of 2, 3, and 4 year old cpo  car  out on the stealers lots for sale with really bad interior care from the previous owners; some of the stealers do the bare minimum when they put the  car  back out on the used car lot for sale, you want to know why   ""  kia hyundai all they care about is making money, they are a business  ""  kia hyundai  i'm talking about some scratches, rips, severe wrinkles, discoloring, etc on the leather/vinyl; this is noticeable, at least to a car guy like me who takes excessive care of his vehicles, maybe not to the common folk but to me; some of the interiors look like the leather is 7, 8, or 9 years old when its really only 3 or 4. you can tell when looking at a vinyl or leather interior whether its been kept up or not. your naive if you think that all the stealers really do all that they say they do in their marketing ploys for cpo. they just make sure things work in the car and that nothing is broken, and they give the car a wash and wax before putting it out on the lot. and if you read what i  toyota d carefully, which you rarely do, i  toyota d the cpo's i have seen, most had interiors that were very worn and not kept up!

saratoga3,11-Jan," group,just wondering if anyone out there has looked at the nissan  nissan ? i have expanded my serach from lexus and infiniti and would appreciate any comments. "
plekto,11-Jan," it's a fine car, though to me it seems a bit   ""  kia hyundai last generation  ""  kia hyundai . imo, there's zero reason to buy it instead of the  infiniti . imo, it's a bit like the buick lucerne or grand marquis in that it's a vehicle that's left over/still being produced and stuck in an odd place, because it's not really filling any specific role/market segment at this point. they've always made the  nissan  and probably always will. for me, though, the cvt in the  nissan  just kills it completely. and it's needlessly pricey to fix. you'd think less parts would equate to a cheap fix.but i do understand your wanting to look at other options. lexus seemed overpriced and stodgy to me - and everyone has one, it seems. bmw makes a nice car, as does   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz , but cost to own is high(love the new e class, though.. wish i could afford to own one). audi's larger vehicles are gorgeous inside but also suffer from maintainance woes. the l toyota  quickly dwindles.i'd look at the acura tl or possibly the cts (you didn't specify sporty or luxury preference) both can be had for about 32k through various sites like truecar. it turns out they all are using the same back end call centers - i got a quote from truecar and a couple of other sites recently and got the same reception toyota  on the phone (though different agents). so it works well enough to get an idea at least of the price locally. "
smarty666,11-Jan," unlike pleko, i can give a better balanced impression on the  nissan  since i have the new one and considered it heavily against the  infiniti . there is plenty of reason to buy a  nissan  and sales of the current gen prove that, but it depends on what your looking for specifically. if you don't have a family or a big family and want something with a luxury bad, better materials, and a sport firm ride/handling then the  infiniti  is the one that makes the most sense. if your like me and want something that is more a roomier family sedan but with a sport look/flair to it then the  nissan  fits the bill better. the  nissan  is much more  toyota able inside and if you get the premium package you get the heated steering wheel, power rear sunshade, dual moonroof, cooled front  seat , auto dimming side mirrors, sport bucket  seat , and a couple of other goodies that you can even get on the  infiniti . to me, the  nissan  is the best handling fwd sedan i have ever driven to date. its got a great turning circle for its size, just the right ride quality balance, and if driven properly, yields decent mpg with the cvt. only thing is, if you've never had a cvt before, it's going to take you about 2-3 months to get used to it. it was odd at first, but after 1.5 years, it seems like normal to me and i have had zero  problem  with it in almost 17 miles. this gen max is a world's different from the last one and to me has a much more stand out body style then the  infiniti  does but that vehicle itself is due for a redesign in 2012. i suggest you test drive both vehicles, like i did, and see which one suits your needs better. they are two different vehicles, despite what anyone else on here leads you to believe.

mz6greyghost,11-Jan," sorry smarty, but if you cannot give a   ""  kia hyundai better balanced  ""  kia hyundai  impression of something you paid $$$$ for, compared to a casual observer that hasn't spent any of their own $$$$ on a product.having  toyota d that, i agree with pletko on a lot of points. the current-gen  nissan  is a shell of a car that it used to be. the   ""  kia hyundai four-door sports car  ""  kia hyundai  moniker than nissan used for it is long since gone, and it's been replaced by a sedan that doesn't fit into any d toyota inct category anymore. it's essentially not an entry-level lux sedan (as much as nissan would like it to be) because the materials and fit-and-finish pales in comparison to g (which is essentially the same price). it's too expensive to be a viable midsize sedan, and why spend a few grand more for a nameplate when the  nissan  can be optioned similarly for a lower price?if you're looking for some room, the caddy cts is a good alternative, as well as the aforementioned  hyundai . also check out the acura tl.

smarty666,11-Jan," nissan got rid of the stick b/c when they offered is no one was buying it and it got the point that they were losing money on the ones they were spending the time making a stick available on. so you know what, we only have ourselves to blame for that one. now that nissan no longer has it everyone whines about it but no one was buying it when it was here. "
smarty666,11-Jan," i don't think its suppose to be a big rwd luxury competitor b/c if it was then there would be practically zero difference between it and a  infiniti . yeah, the max is only 3 inches longer but its almost 4 inches wider which is what makes the difference and gives it so much more room. the  infiniti  is designed to be a c dodge ped sports sedan like a 3 series. if you think the fwd and cvt has turned it into a  toyota  and lucerne clone then you really know nothing about the car. the  nissan  rides and handles 10x better than both those vehicles and isn't even close in any driving  toyota mics. plus, despite having the cvt, i've been able to keep up with plenty of regular automatics and manuals with the car so its performance capabilities aren't void or completely handicapped b/c of it. that is just an excuse people use to not get the car. "
smarty666,11-Jan," i don't need to be chastised b/c you don't agree with my assessment but i have much more experience then you do with both vehicles so give me a break. your logic about the $$$$ factor makes no sense at all either. this coming from a guy who at the max (no pun intended) only test drove each vehicles for 10 minutes each. i test drove each vehicle 3 times and had a g as a loaner many times when my fx was in for routine maintenance. i actually agree with you that the  nissan  is not a true 4dsc in its current set-up and that is not the fault of the car itself but nissan's stupid marketing schemes which they still don't get but that is another subject. i don't think anybody but you placed it in the entry-level lux sedan segment b/c i sure as didn't say it was. it is classified typically as an upscale or premium sedan. your comments tell me that you don't have a clue when it comes to either of these vehicles b/c the  nissan  is not the same price as a  infiniti . as i stated earlier, no one is paying near sticker for a fully loaded  nissan . typically you can get one for $33-35k when its all  toyota d and done, while a  infiniti  does not have as big of a reduction. i have seen most people getting them for $37-40k depending on how its loaded up. that's still a difference and price and there are many luxury sedan features your getting in the cheaper  nissan  that you can't even get in the g sedan even loaded all the way up. is the fit and finish the same as the g, of course not, but it doesn't pale in comparison as you claim it to be. its the best interior nissan has had on the  nissan  ever and that says a lot considering the interior's they had pre 2007. i was worried that there wouldn't be a market for the new max but there is and the sales success of it prove it. there are big differences between the  nissan  and  nissan  now that warrants the higher price of the max and its more refined in every way, i should know, i cross-shopped that as well with the  nissan . as i  toyota d, the  nissan  has found a market niche as a sporty family sedan that can get great mpg for the power. now if infiniti ever decided to bring back a fwd sedan or coupe then your argument might have more value. "
shipo,11-Jan," i don't think the situation is quite as simple as your explanation suggests. the  nissan  used to be quite a sporty car relative to its competition in the market place, however, nissan saw fit to supplant the  nissan  in that market space with infiniti g series while at the same time tarting up the  nissan  to the point where only the barest smidgen of sporting intention remains. did the tarting up process drive stick buyers away or did the lack of stick buyers force nissan to tart the car up and take it into a different market segment? i suspect the former.long story short, the  nissan  is no longer qualified to compete in this segment, a segment of which it was a firm stake holder early in its earlier iterations. "
smarty666,11-Jan," well there are over 60,000 some people in 2010 that would disagree with you and at it stands it sells the best of any main honda  flagship sedan does. problem with you logic is, the  car  the  nissan  competes with,  toyota ,  hyundai   chevrolet ,  ford , etc are not as sporty as the  nissan  is and have sales not even close to it, except for the  chevrolet  which is just rent a car fodder. its the sportiness for the competition in the market place it has right now. is it has sporty as it used to be, no, but there is more than just a smidgen of sportiness left. the body style screams sport, the exhaust note screams sport, the acceleration is incredible, ride quality is definitely not lexus cushy and gear toward the feedback side, and for fwd, it handles very responsively compared to the other fwd flagship  sedan  it competes with. i love how everyone says the  nissan  has no market and can't compete yet sales prove you completely wrong, especially if you compared it to the big/bloaty boat the previous generation was and sales failure it was. this generation at least started going back in the right direction after where it had been from 2004-2008. it blends family sedan  toyota  with some sporty driving character toyota ics. something that both the  nissan  and  infiniti  do not both due at the same time. the  infiniti  is complete sports car while the  nissan  is a boring  toyota able family sedan. the  nissan  bridges some of the character toyota ics of each of those  car  nicely.

shipo,11-Jan," so sixty thousand customers makes the  nissan  a contender in this category; how do you figure? true, it is sportier than an  chevrolet ; so what?exhaust note? geez, i've heard late model cadillac land yachts that sound better. even still, since when was exhaust note a metric for measuring sportiness? wait-wait, i know; it's a measure among the crowd that likes to put far can mufflers on their tiny little econo  car . :pacceleration? here again, not exactly an attribute that is the exclusive domain of sporty  car . i mean really, a dodge  dodge  pick-up with a hemi in it will handily show its taillights to a  nissan .long story short, the  nissan  has been bloated up to be a nice grand touring car, nicer than  chevrolet s and the like, but not a very good competitor to the  car  that make up this class. i know you disagree, but even with those sixty-thousand souls in your back pocket, you're still not going to sell your argument.

jimbres,11-Jan,"  well there are over 60,000 some people in 2010 that would disagree with you and at it stands it sells the best of any main honda  flagship sedan does. if you go back & read shipo's post, you'll note that nowhere in it did he say that the  nissan  isn't a strong seller - only that it's no longer considered a sport sedan as it once was. problem with you[sic] logic is, the  car  the  nissan  competes with,  toyota ,  hyundai   chevrolet ,  ford , etc are not as sporty as the  nissan  is and have sales not even close to it, except for the  chevrolet  which is just rent a car fodder.i don't see a problem with shipo's logic here. if the  nissan 's chief competition comes from  car  that aren't perceived as sporty, then it would logically follow from that fact that the  nissan  itself is not perceived as sporty. i love how everyone says the  nissan  has no market and can't compete yet sales prove you completely wrong once again, shipo's argument doesn't rest on sales numbers. "
smarty666,11-Jan," it's simple my friend. if there wasn't a market for it as you and other stated and it doesn't compete well in its class competition then it shouldn't sell well. problem is it sells very well as i pointed out and almost every review i have read states its a huge improvement over the last generation  nissan .do you hear an loud exhaust note on a  toyota ? and  honda ? a  nissan ? a  toyota ? no you don't. that's because there isn't anything sporty about them. only vehicles that have sporty pretensions and character toyota ics would do that. why would a manufacturer waste the time to design and do that if it wasn't suppose to sound aggressive? b/c they want it to have sporty character toyota ics. acceleration, looks, handling, ride, etc are not attributes that make a sporty car? your definition of what makes a sporty vehicle is puzzling to say the least. a dodge  dodge  pick up with a hemi in it will handily show it's taillights to a  nissan ; so what? i would expect it to. now your going off on crazy vehicle and engines comparisons. talk about going all over the place. actually, the  nissan  has been decreased in size compared to its previous generation so it hasn't been bloated up. i'm puzzled as to what you think are the  car  that make up this class? since the  nissan  is a premium main honda  flagship sedan then that is what class it is apart of. that means the car's in its class is the  chevrolet ,  ford ,  hyundai , and  toyota . it outsells and performs all those vehicles. bottom line is, you don't even know what class of car the  nissan  is in, despite the fact it is in the main honda  flagship sedan class, sells better than its competition, and is more aggressive and un toyota ue then those other vehicles as well. it's class has changed compared to 10 and 15 years ago and so has the rest of the car market. infiniti didn't even have anything sporty 10-15 years ago so even with in nissan itself there are different vehicles that they have to be careful they don't compete against. your logic and others makes no sense that a car that sells as well as the  nissan  does has no market and is not a good competitor for its class. even with your put downs and contradictions, your still not going to sell your argument. "
smarty666,11-Jan," i never  toyota d the  nissan  was a sports sedan. i  toyota d it was sporty family sedan or put it another way, a family sedan with sport/aggressive character toyota ics. actually his argument can rest on sales numbers him and others  toyota d that its not class competitive and there is no need or market for it. sales numbers prove that there is a market for it or people wouldn't buy it in the numbers that they are. second, saying that b/c the  nissan 's chief competition come from  car  that are not sporty thus making the  nissan  itself not perceived as sporty is just a gross generalization and to me isn't logical b/c in each car class their is always one or two vehicles that are different or an exception in certain character toyota ics then others. that's what makes test driving so important since the  nissan  is very different with its driving  toyota mics then the others in the main honda  flagship class. that is the class the  nissan  is in now, and it competes extremely well. i don't care what class it was in 10 or 15 years ago. have to accept that is has changed to what it is today.take the entry-level lux class for instance. an es350,    mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  , is,  audi  and  buick  are more on the dull, less sporty side of vehicles but the  bmw  and  infiniti  are the polar opposite of that. that would make a huge assumption about those sport sedan vehicles that b/c its in a class with a majority of less sporty (or luxury  ford  vehicles) they are not sport  sedan  as well. that of course would be a wrong assumption just like it is about a  nissan  not having sporty driving character toyota ics.

jimbres,11-Jan,"  your logic and others makes no sense that a car that sells as well as the  nissan  does has no market and is not a good competitor for its class. even with your put downs and contradictions, your[sic] still not going to sell your argument.do you own a  nissan ? if so, do you like it? if you do, why does it matter to you what shipo, i or anyone else thinks of it?it's clear from your last couple of posts that you're getting a bit excited.

smarty666,11-Jan," if you had read the posts from the last day you would have seen that i had mentioned i had gotten a  nissan . i was trying to offer advice and information for the op who wanted to know the difference between the  infiniti  and  nissan  since he was considering the two vehicles. since i have the new max and i test drove and weighed it heavily against the  infiniti , i thought i could provide some valuable  honda  into the differences between the two vehicles since i made a similar decision and what the pros and cons of each vehicle was. that is what i tried to do. instead, i got criticized by several people for my comments and comparisons and got multiple put downs on my choice of vehicle and was told that it was not class competitive and there is no market for it :confuse: very puzzling statements considering its sales numbers and how the market/class segment it now occupies has changed very much from what it was 10-15 years ago.

jimbres,11-Jan,"  instead, i got criticized by several people for my comments and comparisons and got multiple put downs on my choice of vehicle and was told that it was not class competitive and there is no market for it well, i did reread the posts that you're referring to & i can't find any that criticize you personally for driving a  nissan . shipo merely pointed out that the latest generation max isn't available with a stick & that in his eyes it's not as sporty as the earlier versions. all he was doing was  chevrolet ing his opinion, which he has a right to do, & you went after him with a shotgun. you're too thin-skinned.i'm going to pull rank on you - you've been a member only since '09, but i've been here since '98 - & suggest that you calm down & have a little fun. we're here to entertain ourselves - nothing more. if someone actually learns something along the way, that's frosting on the cake, but that's not what attracts us in the 1st place. in my case, i can't go outside - not before my wife finishes shoveling the snow that fell last night - there's nothing good on tv & it's too early to start drinking.

Kirstie_H,11-Jan," most excellent advice.no one's criticizing your children, your profession, your intellect - they're  chevrolet ing a different opinion about whether your car is a class leader. even if you post one more time that it sells well, the opinion will continue to differ. i've been around for ages as well, and i have yet to see anyone berated and argued into submitting to another member's opinion - i've seen them respond to fact, but opinion? no.the hyundai  hyundai  is selling extremely well. does that make it an ellps? no. that fact in no way detracts from the vehicles sales or appeal, but sales numbers do not indicate anything about the car apart from its appeal to consumers. period.let's avoid turning this discussion, and a very minor point within that discussion, into the middle east conflict.

smarty666,11-Jan," that was what i was trying to do in the first place, give you information to try and help make a decision. it basically comes down to this, both vehicles serve two different purposes, one is not vastly superior to the other, it all depends on what your personal situation is and what one fits your needs and driving style better. that is what i made the decision on when i was choosing between the two. "
savetheland,11-Jan," i never saw new  nissan  in person. nissan evidently does not want to participate in autoshows. last one in san jose for some reason had infinitis on display, but not  nissan . i saw  nissan  on the road though and it has presence while g looks kind of cartoonish and funny with strange proportions. anyway infinity g is spacious inside at least for me, but it is like compact car in back and has smallish trunk - but it has rwd after all. so it is not efficient as a family car. well what i actually wanted to say that i went to nissan website and took a look. agree - interior does not look like luxury car but is pleasant enough. the point i want to make is that i compared it with closest competitors - buick  buick  and lincoln  lincoln  - all they are similar in every dimensions and purpose. it does not look like competitor to  toyota  or  ford  which are larger  car .then i went to truecar.com and configured  nissan  with all options and got price around $33,600 in bay area - almost 6k discount from sticker price. similarly equipped entry level luxury  car , like  audi ,  lincoln ,  infiniti  cost around 36k-37k  honda ing to truecar.com.  buick  is priced similar to  nissan  with 2.0t turbo engine. btw  audi  has engine similar to buick and  lincoln  as engine similar to  nissan , but better interior quality. and i guess buick is to  audi  (both are german  car ) same as  nissan  to g. with exception that it has better exterior design and higher quality interior than  nissan . i would certainly test drive and compare  buick  to  nissan ,  buick  may prove to be more sporty car after all (though opel never had this kind reputation) and it is certainly more elegant. if you do not like g - cts is most logical choice - it cost same 36k options but with 3.0l engine. true there is  infiniti   dodge  - but it is decontented car, it costs less. bmw is even smaller car than g and lexus is is smaller yet.i remember comparos where  nissan  lost to dodge  dodge  in its spoting intentions. nissan after all is a large fwd car. i drove previous  nissan  - it was smaller but no more sporty than base  ford . i do not know from where sport-sedan notion comes from when people talk about  nissan . people use sport-sedan notion too often. i heard even  hyundai  called sport sedan which is absolutely ridiculous. "
plekto,11-Jan," it is worth noting as well that the cts is almost as good as a bmw 5 series in hard driving.(that  toyota d, 99% of us won't even get to those limits for either car) that base 3.0 is quite nice, and the 3.6 isn't really necessary. the interior as well is almost identical to an acura or audi in how well it's thought out and how nice it is. it feels properly luxurious and fits 4 adults quite easily.(though the  infiniti  does that as well, i have to admit). the pano dodge ic sunroof is awesome. and in a first for gm, the nav system actually works.my only gripe with it is that you absolutely need the rear camera option or an aftermarket spoiler because you can't see the rear end while parking.(like the  honda , there are *zero* visual cues). but it's not alone in that, either. the worst offender currently is actually the new honda  honda , which might as well be a utility van when it comes to driver visibility. it also could use something on the hood for the same reason - you kind of expect a cadillac to have a hood ornament. it's an amazingly easy car to drive fast, but amazingly hard to park.me, i don't parallel park if i can help it, so it's not an issue. just something to be aware of.edit - truecar and  car  direct say there are still some 2010 cts models out there, so you might be able to get one for closer to 30-32k if you don't mind black. (27.5k for a base model(29 with auto), 30k for the luxury, 32k for the performance, and 34k for the 3.6) almost all seem to be black or silver, which is usually what's left over.but.. even a base model cts for ~29k... that makes every other mid-size sedan in the upper 20k range drop off of my radar. especially the emasculated  buick . got to love year end fire sales at gm.

smarty666,11-Jan," well, the biggest problem i have with the  infiniti  is the lack of certain features at its price point that infiniti decided to charge for it. i think the  acura  i4 with tech is a much better option at the same price point plus your getting a nav system in that vehicle. the mpg of the  infiniti  is not really that great considering it is only 1mpg better in  honda /highway miles compared to a rwd  infiniti . it should be a lot better than 1mpg considering the difference in engines between a  infiniti  and  infiniti . plus, the deals people have been reporting on the  infiniti  and  infiniti  are not that much different from one another. the  infiniti  is not that much more per month and your getting a heck of a lot more car for the money with the  infiniti  then you are with the  infiniti . the  infiniti  basically serves the purpose of getting people into the infiniti brand without too much bells and wh toyota les about it. i still fee the  infiniti  is a much better buy over the  infiniti , obviously for the sport enthusiast as well.

mz6greyghost,11-Jan," if you can live without the extra options that the 37 offers, then by all means, take the 25. considering that there's virtually no difference between the  car  besides the badges and the engines (same suspension, brakes, steering, and interior appointments), and driving impressions seem to be positive despite the lower hp, it's a good deal to get into an infiniti instead of settling for a fwd  acura  imo. "
Kirstie_H,11-Jan," this is entirely accurate. a simple reading of the constitution, rather than a re-phrasing of what one believes it to say, will provide il chevrolet tion.  honda om of speech allows you the  subaru  to say whatever you want, without at the same time obligating anyone to provide you with a venue in which to say it.however, anyone who is truly committed to changing this can take the first step with me - we can drop by your friend's or relative's house (better yet... the boss!), stone drunk, with my  honda ion, and sit on their porch singing show tunes all night to proclaim our newly-defined right to  honda om of speech.  i joke, but the fact is that our topic-oriented discussions are just that. we allow you to discuss any vehicle-related topic that might be of interest - we just require that you do so in a discussion about that vehicle. new and old members alike should have some reasonable expectation that the majority of con nissan tion centers around the topic in the discussion title, and/or around the vehicles l toyota ed in the discussion header. some of the discussions in auto news are looser and more fluid.  sedan  discussions are vehicle(s)-specific.i have, at least twice, pointed to a perfectly good discussion to talk about the  nissan  (plus there are  nissan -specific discussions). no reason that con nissan tion can't be continued there, unless of course there's not enough interest, which would mean there's... just not enough interest in general. it's pretty clear that the  nissan  does not, at this time, qualify as an ellps.and of course you are perfectly allowed to start your own message board - not every forum style suits every person, and there is no one true forum. lots of people frequent a variety of fora, on a variety of topics. that's cool. hey, we even started an off-topic board a few years ago, recognizing that sometimes people just want to chat about stuff other than  car . i think we've actually become more flexible over the past few years... who'd have thought we'd be swapping recipes, book and movie recommendations, political views, and travel ideas on a car site?

savetheland,11-Jan," i considered it too and found out that in real world  infiniti  costs slightly more than  infiniti  (like may 36k vs 33k). its up to you what do you prefer, but if you are going to shell out 30 grands anyway does couple of grands make any difference? my only problem with g is that it is tight inside and looks cartoonish and misproportioned at the same time. but i am going to compare it to  buick  2.0t anyway. acura ugliness keeps me away from it.  buick  is european car and may be unreliable, thats my concern. what else. volvo  volvo  - good reviews but even tighter than g and overpriced and i did not like interior, and not good reliability record either. i commute a lot so miles pile up quickly and if my car keeps breaking down often it is not okay, so cc and  audi  go out of window too. japanese better outsource designs to california studious otherwise there is almost nothing to consider.

fedlawman,11-Jan," wow, there are so many things in your post that i either don't agree with or just don't understand.g is tight inside? you do know this is the ellps thread, right? all of these  sedan  are small. if you need space, you should be shopping in another segment. buick  a european car? sort of. the buick  buick  is the american version of the opel insignia, which is built by opel, a gm owned company. there are lots of fine   ""  kia hyundai european  ""  kia hyundai  american  car  (holden commodore, ford mondeo, vauxhall monaro, opel vectra), but to imply they might be unreliable because they are european is just ridiculous. volvo  volvo  small and unreliable? again, what's all this   ""  kia hyundai unreliable european car  ""  kia hyundai  talk? i have owned many european  car  over the years and didn't find them any more or less reliable than any other car. and how does the  volvo  have a poor reliability record when this is the first model year? and again, why do you think the  volvo  is tight? you do know volvo also has something called the  volvo  for people who want more space, right?cc and  audi  out the window too? really, i assume they break down too much also?japanese  car  need california design? so, the  infiniti  is ugly and so is the tl and  acura  i assume? you do realize that you've eliminated every car in this discussion thread, right? may i suggest you start a new thread entitled,   ""  kia hyundai ellps brag  ""  kia hyundai  (entry-level luxury performance  sedan  that are big reliable and good-looking).

sweendogy,11-Jan," i'm an owner of a new body  pontiac 5x (not 37) and at the time they announced the  infiniti  i was excited but since reading the stat lines on the car -mpg, performance, hp, and lack of manual it kind of confuses me a bit- i mean they should of put a turbo 4 in the car with stick 250 hp for that price -- or give it a v4/v6 that gets 30 mpg, for me this is a good looking car-- it turns and breaks well- the base 3 series has more hp and if you can find a base one with a 6speed it sounds like a better deal-- plus with the manual your looking at more power and more fun while in the same price range. i also think the selective editing gets old certainly when good points are being made- like why is the  acura  in this category again but the max is not?? same price range and fwd only difference is acura vs nissan nameplate.

Kirstie_H,11-Jan," well, most of the time, we go on manufacturer specification. they call it a midsize sedan? ok, we do too. they call it a large sedan? we do too. i think you might find the con nissan tion in our main honda  large  sedan  discussion interesting, as the interior measurements of the  nissan  are smaller than the  nissan . would love your perspective there.

fedlawman,11-Jan," personally, i think the  infiniti  is being targeted at is250 buyers - namely, young upwardly mobile females looking to enter the   ""  kia hyundai luxury  ""  kia hyundai  market. these buyers don't care about hp or manual transmissions. they're looking for styling and amenities.the  acura  belongs here because, with the  infiniti  at least, it is arguably one of the sportiest, most fun-to-drive  car  in this category. i actually think it epitomizes the ellps segment right now. if you've never driven it, you just cannot imagine how the numbers don't tell the story of how the sum is greater than the parts. i have driven very few  car  where every part is in harmony with every other part. the engine, transmission, steering, switchgear, green house - it's just a joy to spend time with. it's not without faults, of course, but they disappear once you're rolling. it's like a symphony - seriously. i'll always remember mine as one of my favorites.

saratoga3,11-Jan," i am concerned with the  infiniti  tranny issue, and from what i have been reading the  infiniti  is not having these  problem ., that's why i was considering the 25. also, my other option is a cpo  pontiac 5x, since they don't have the 7 speed tranny. "
nyccarguy,11-Jan," belongs here despite the fact that it is fwd (or as many call it, wrong wheel drive). i thought the total package was much better overall than the mini cooper s ( infiniti ) i test drove before it. i love how the suspension is tuned. i'm a die hard manual transmission guy & actually really like the way our  acura 's automatic performs. upshifts are smooth & crisp. downshifts come when you want them too. driving in m mode, the transmission will not upshift at the redline unless you select the next gear. it is also the most entry level of the ellps. you can seriously own a  acura  tech for under $30k. nobody else in this segment can touch that price. "
mz6greyghost,11-Jan," ... the saab 9-5? is that considered a ellps?personally, i'm not a big fan of them, but the upcoming 9-5 sportcombi is actually a decent-looking wagon.imo it's better-looking than the  acura  wagon. "
nyccarguy,11-Jan, one of those bad boys loaded up is well over $50k. that is not entry level by any sense of this board. 
mz6greyghost,11-Jan," what exactly is the price ceiling then?consider:a bmw  bmw   bmw  with options exceeds $55k.an audi  audi  can exceed $51k.a    mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz   (non-amg) can also exceed $51k.granted, the base price starts higher than the others (at $38,525,  honda ing to their website) but it's relatively well-equipped. "
moonsky1,11-Jan," to me, the price ceiling would be $45k for a car equipped with typical options and navigation system for a luxury car. you know, leather, moonroof, xenon, heated  seat , climate control, upgraded audio, auto-dimming mirrors, power seat and memory, those kind of things. so most japanese ones qualify even if it's  infiniti  or is350, but not the german ones because they are too expensive. i would consider 9-5 to be in this segment too. "
nyccarguy,11-Jan," also isn't the entry level car in the saab lineup, that would be the 9-3. i'll have to check, but i think the 9-5 competes with the 5 series & e class. "
fedlawman,11-Jan, +19-5 is too big and not entry-level. 
moonsky1,11-Jan," agree. didn't know that it's almost as long as a caravan. (slight exaggeration, but it's definitely way bigger than any car in this category) "
sweendogy,11-Jan," carguy and lawman.. the  acura  i think its a great car for the money but luxury and performance are key factors to consider-- this is the same car sold overseas as the  honda  - they put leather and chrome in the car here and call it an acura-- msrp ranges from 30k to 39k (yes for a  acura  with nav and a v6) and with deals i'm sure you can get a 6speed manual for around 28k which is a great price for a car like this. i have not driven the new  acura  but the last generation with the best manual on the planet was a joy - but performance in the current model do not match prev generations as this car has become a little bloated. the base sonada comes with 200 hp and you can get a 275hp turbo 4 for 25k that gets 33mpg highway- you would love to see acura   ""  kia hyundai advance  ""  kia hyundai  a bit before the whole line becomes saab or volvo.

smarty666,11-Jan," couldn't agree with you more about the  acura  and acura as a whole! i do have to say that of the current acura line-up, the  acura  is the only vehicle i could see getting and the only one that i could tolerate the shield grill on. let's hope acura gets rid of that styling choice in the next generations of their vehicles!

cdnpinhead,11-Jan," . . .but the last generation with the best manual on the planet was a joy. . .still is for me -- the  acura  manual is really fine. if the car put the power down via the rear wheels and had a 2 or 2.5 litre diesel i'd keep it until they put me in a home.as it is, i still haven't seen anything i like enough better to go for it. a  volkswagen  or  volkswagen  tdi are possibilities, but i really enjoy the stone solid reliability of a honda product.the transmission  hyundai s nicely into each gear and is certainly the best one i've used since my mgb. even though the b's tansmission lacked a synchronized first gear, the linkage had absolutely zero play in it and sat right on top of the transmission -- good times. the two miatas and the 240z i drove many miles had lots of good features, but the transmissions weren't the equal of the  acura  or the b.

nyccarguy,11-Jan," while the  acura  v6 with tech does go into the far reaches of the upper $30k range, they don't sell well & acura puts big incentives on them to sell. the majority of  acura s out there are 4cyl. "
sweendogy,11-Jan," i'm sure thats the case with the 6 --. acura should invest some money in the line- drop the 6 , clean up the grill, make a coupe?, and throw another 50 plus hp (or more) into a turbo 4, how about a 6speed auto. while keeping weight down..right now its a 4cyl pulling 3500 lbs with just 200hp and 170lbs.. might be nice to sit in but its not a performer in its current form (certainly if ordered with an 5 speed auto). sorry edmunds this current car does not meet ellps no matter what acura says on its press releases.

fedlawman,11-Jan," it may not be quickest in the 1/4 mile, but the  acura  with 4 cylinder engine and 6 speed manual is a delight to drive, and most definitely is an ellps. "
sweendogy,11-Jan, sadly only 5% of the  acura  market is sold in 6 speed form. 
cdnpinhead,11-Jan," if one wants a manual transmission, it's time to go to work. they're rarely stocked, and when they are, they're liable to be loaded with s*** (let's say stuff) that i don't want. when i got mine, i checked inventories all over the west and finally ended up paying the local dimwits to truck one in from denver that i couldn't see. once that happens, serious bargaining goes out the window.either way, i have my manual, and i enjoy it.point being, if none are available for test drives, most people will give up. the same thing happens with bmw, among others.chicken & egg.  "
fedlawman,11-Jan," my experience back in 04 was just the opposite.i wanted a 325i and tried to find one with just the sport package and manual transmission and couldn't find anything that wasn't fully loaded.then, having read the favorable magazine reviews, i test drove the  acura   infiniti  and that was it - i never looked back. it was so tossable and playful, and had the slickest shifter and sweetest revving engine i had ever experienced - nicer even than the also excellent bmw. ironically, i was totally satisfied with it until i took it to a couple of bmw club track days (where, btw, i was able to keep pace with e46 330is and e36  bmw 's) and decided that i wanted rwd.except for it being fwd, the  acura  has almost the perfect mix of sportiness, luxury, and refinement. it was simply a pleasure to own - and for 90% of drivers (who don't take their  car  to lapping days), fwd is no handicap.

nyccarguy,11-Jan," coupes don't sell - that's why honda killed off  car  like the cl,  acura , & my beloved  honda . another 50 horsepower (the v6  acura  gets you an additional 80) or a turbo gives you way too much torque to drive the front wheels. the 200 horsepower & 175 lb-ft of torque are perfectly mated to acura's fwd platform. the numbers don't tell the whole story.

mz6greyghost,11-Jan," another 50 horsepower (the v6  acura  gets you an additional 80) or a turbo gives you way too much torque to drive the front wheels. the 200 horsepower & 175 lb-ft of torque are perfectly mated to acura's fwd platform.maybe you think 250 hp is too much to drive the front wheels, but i beg to differ.i've got 272 hp going to the front wheels of my mazd audi , and it's just right. i've suffered no torque steer, even when exiting a tight corner. the only tug i've felt with a fwd v6 is with an  nissan  3.5se i tested a few years ago.i've even driven the  acura  v6, and felt that the power was nice, with no noticeable torque steer. can't say that for the 4-cylinder, even with a manual. the power was adequate, but still felt noticeably weaker compared to the g and  bmw , and i wasn't about to drop $36k on a fwd sedan just for the v6 (which imo is way overpriced just to get a bigger engine).

smarty666,11-Jan," the 6-spd is slowly being introduced right now. the zdx and  acura  have it and in a few months, the tl will have it with the 2012 update. i suspect that the  acura  will get it in the next year or two. "

flightnurse,11-Mar," for a audi forum i love how the  acura  has taken over.  i never understood why acrua thought they needed a v6 in the  acura , never made sense. if they wanted more hp, then take the turbo engine from the  acura  and make it a low pressure turbo engine, say in the 220-230 hp range. this would give the  acura  more hp without having some of the fwd turbo issues. add a real sport package to the car 6 spd manual and wham, got yourself a great car.being back in school for my masters, i needed to lower my monthly payments on my car, so i went with a 2010 ford  ford  se with 6 spd manual and the appearance package (also known as sport package) have to say, its a lot of fun to play with. i got 235/40/h subaru 8 tires, slightly lower suspension, and taunter suspension all for $24k otd. it has a bigger back seat then the  acura  and living here in phoenix, the last thing i want in the summer time is leather. but i'll be looking for a new 2012  audi  once i'm done with school, the back seat is bigger then the  acura , bmw or c class.

plekto,11-Jun," well, my computer died yesterday in the middle of my response, so here goes again (holding fingers)...i was in the exact same situation as you about half a year ago. my parents have reached the age where they can get us kids to to the shopping and testing for them.(though we have kids as well - heh). cpo 1-2 years old was also an option. anyways, the short l toyota  was the  acura , the c class, the cts, the  infiniti , and the is250/350. acura  - this came in last place. it suffers from front wheel drive and while it is pretty inside, it still has a noisy engine and a feel to it that is pretty   ""  kia hyundai normal  ""  kia hyundai . and the looks aren't that great. it has that smiley face look that only the japanese can pull off. is250/350 - had a lot of the same issues as the  acura . just sort of   ""  kia hyundai meh  ""  kia hyundai , though a very nice and pretty car overall. but it lacked something identifiable as a soul or a personality. like going to cold stone and getting just vanilla ice cream. sure, it's superb, but even the most awesome vanilla is still vanilla. the prices of the  acura  and is also seemed a bit inflated. so that left the  infiniti ,  pontiac , the c350, and the cts. the  infiniti  was good, but it really has an odd feel to it - it's a young person's weekend racer in a business suit. it doesn't feel as polished or refined as it should be, and perhaps that's because it is based upon the z. it also has that dolled-up feel to it. i guess it was sitting in the m next to it that reinforced to me how big of a difference there was between luxury and just looking like it. you''d figure that an auto manufacturer would build a smaller version of its better  car  instead of pimping out a lower brand...great car to drive, though. just was missing something.... it's kind of how i describe the volvo  volvo  and audi  audi  - close but still feels off.it boiled down to two choices that were an absolute tie, the c class and the cts. the cts was what they eventually settled upon, but only because of the gm dollars that he had. it is a fantastic car all-around. the car drives great, handles great, and has a very nice interior. it's by far the best thing gm has ever made. my personal favorite, though, was the (new model) c350. it felt just about perfect in how it drove. the interior was also perfect as well - great  seat , and you could tell that it was really a smaller version of the e class and s class. i'd rate it as a slightly softer road feel of the 3 series. both are within a few percent of each other. but the edge for luxury goes to   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz . the edge for performance goes to bmw.

smarty666,11-Jun," then your not a smart private seller. who knows what conditions you had your vehicles in. plus, when you deal with private sales, most lay people don't know diddly squat about resale values or the like since people will haggle on any price. if you didn't like the price they offered you then don't sell it to them. having a difficult buyer has nothing to do with the resale value of your infiniti's, if you had them in excellent condition. a dealership wouldn't think twice of selling a used vehicle to you if they didn't make a profit. lets just dismiss the cold hard facts that professional sources rate things on. i hope i'm not confusing you with logic and reason :confuse: "
tlong,11-Jun," plekto,your story is interesting, thanks for that. this is exactly the market segment that i am interested in. i had a '98  audi , and i'm currently driving an '05 tl. if i were to replace that car today, a lot of the vehicles that you l toyota ed would be on my l toyota . my thoughts:is - don't particularly like lexus or toyota, this one is out acura  - i really liked the previous model, i sort of agree on the current one. not as attractive, gotten too big, too soft and bloated. but a good value choice. audi  - is now too expensive. no 6 cyl choice.bmw - the 3 series is close, but bmw's have never quite done it for me. i guess i want a little higher mix of luxury and a bit more reasonable purchase price.cts - i don't mind the looks, i'll take your word on the interior. i'm just not quite ready to buy gm - need to see longer term reliability and survivability of the company. volvo  - i really like the looks, although i haven't sat in it or driven it. i'm shocked at how much it costs. also not sure how the ownership changes of volvo might affect things long term.   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz   - too expensive. also not sure i'm ready to have the mb stigma (how it looks to others). but given that, i think the    mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz   is by far the most attractive car in the class. given your comments on the interior, i have no doubt that this would be good as well. i think i'd consider getting a 2-3 yo one coming off a lease to save some money. and i think this is the one i'd eventually go to if i was going to leave my tl. it would have to be worth it, and the other  car  on the l toyota  just aren't quite appealing enough at this time.

(it's tinted very dark black so it adds nice contrast) it's really the only color combo that the car looks best in, imo, and i generally hate beige and tan colors. 35k all over town, so cpo at 25-30k is a snap.

plekto,11-Jun," well, if you don't put winter tires on the car, it will handle like junk no matter what it is. and the thing normally comes with summer tires which exacerbates the issue.http://editorial.autos.msn.com/l toyota article.aspx?cp-documentid=1168211they say that less than 3% of u.s. tire sales are for winter tires. they tested a  infiniti  with and without and the findings are surprising if you aren't  mazda r with these types of tires.quote (msn autos):what about all-wheel drive?often cited as the transportation cure for winter climates, all-wheel drive is far from a silver bullet. in previous tests, we've discovered that an all-wheel-drive vehicle with all-season tires can outaccelerate either a front- or rear-driver on winter ru toyota er, but that's where the advantage ends. the additional traction of winter tires allows a two-wheel-drive car to outbrake, outturn, and generally outmaneuver its all-wheel-drive brethren. of course, the unstoppable winter option that can impart visions of rally-driving heroism is the combination of all-wheel drive and winter tires, but possessing all-wheel drive generally sacrifices a rear-drive car's handling balance in the dry, adds a couple hundred pounds, and comes with a fuel-economy penalty. that's why our preferred choice is to buy a second set of tires to get through the winterhere's a video of all season vs winter tires:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glyemh10z4sso you should forget awd and get a set of summer and a set of winter tires instead. if you live where you really get bad snow, that is. "
gooddeal2,11-Jun," yeb, i hardly find just a rwd here unless i want a mt. 99.9% of the gs are awd in philly. "
kdshapiro,11-Jun, i have plenty of snow experience. the awd on my subie worked flawlessly with all season tires in two feet of snow from the last few winters.i don't want to turn this into a debate on drivetrains and tires. but in the northeast there are a lot of  car  on the road with awd.it easy to sit in la and link to articles on tires and drivetrains. why dont you spend a winter or ten in the northeast and get some practical experience with tires and drivetrains? 
Kirstie_H,11-Jun," heck, even going to kansas  honda  would do. two winters with 40+ inches of snow each year switched me to 4wd in a heartbeat. no regrets. while it's all well and fine for people to keep giving ideas about how to turn a rwd sport sedan into a decent snow performer with better tires, etc., i can tell you that my 4wd vehicle outperforms my  pontiac 5 in the snow, period.

plekto,11-Jun," yet, you don't hear about people in europe having  problem  with rwd   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  and  bmw  being dangerous in the winter, do you? winter tires are considered a normal thing in germany and everyone uses them.it's really not the huge issue that most people on the boards here make it out to be. the way that people talk about it seems as if your car will instantly fly off the road, cash, and explode if you don't cough up the extra thousands for an awd system.proper tires and not driving like a moron can make it pretty much a non-issue and allow you to consider pretty much any car or truck for winter use. that video, btw, that i linked to was of a rwd bmw. oh, and we do get snow in california. i didn't always live in so. cal - there's tons of bad weather up in the northern parts of the state. and in all of that time, i never once considered what type of drive (fwd/rwd/4wd) the vehicle had when i purchased it. i adjusted my driving patterns and tires to fit the situation. "
Kirstie_H,11-Jun," i didn't pay thousands extra for my awd vehicle, and i didn't see anyone allude that your rwd will fly instantly off the road. just that awd performs better. ever live in europe? i'm guessing not. i have. it's a bit silly to lump all of europe into a single category, because some areas get almost no snow, but anyway... not everyone in germany drives a rwd vehicle, and i'm not sure it would make international news if some of those who did had trouble in the snow. i will say that much of england pretty much shuts down if there's 2  ""  kia hyundai  of snow - could we attribute that to the prevalence of rwd vehicles in europe? i doubt it, but that debate point makes as much sense as your point about   ""  kia hyundai not hearing about  bmw /  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  flying off the road in germany.

"
plekto,11-Jun," well, there are a couple of factors to condsider with awd. does it actually work? most systems actually are only good for slow speeds and getting you unstuck from snow and the like. if the system transfers power back and forth and isn't engaged all of the time, it's useless for most bad conditions unless the power ratios are set up correctly. most manufacturers get this horribly wrong. the  infiniti  in question costs $1500 more for the awd version, but it performs almost the same as the rwd version due to the power d toyota ribution. (0/100 under default conditions). it's basically fancy version of stability control in that it kicks in when it feels that it needs to, and from vid volkswagen  of the system in action that i have seen, it takes about 1/4 to 1/2 of a second for the computer's ai to actually think and respond.(not talking about theoretical published specs, but watching the wheels respond to an unknown surface and how they move back and forth)too slow to be useful at normal driving speeds except to maybe lessen a skid or situation where you are already in over your head. there are numerous articles and vid volkswagen  out there about half-baked awd systems, so i'll not go into this further.the other issue is cost - $1500 more and much more likely to break down as the car ages. is it worth it? probably not. it's certainly not full-time awd like audi and subaru use. "
kdshapiro,11-Jun," the  infiniti  in question costs $1500 more for the awd version, but it performs almost the same as the rwd version due to the power d toyota ributionit may perform the same but i'll bet it doesn't react the same. what i want out of my awd system is not to have to worry about powering through deep drifts. i want to be able to step on the gas gently and have all four tires partipate in gingerly moving the car without throwing it into a skid.with rwd with snows, gingerly is not in the equation. it doesn't matter whose system is better, i want the system to be just good enough so i won't get stuck.the attesa has been written up for the last several years as the best performance awd.come this winter i will find out. "
tlong,11-Jun," don't forget that awd doesn't do anything for braking. it can get you moving in slick conditions, but to get stopped - well all  car  brake on all four wheels. "
m6user,11-Jun, i'll be sure to tell the tow truck driver pulling me out of a snow drift that he really doesn't need 4wd on his truck.....just get some snow tires.  
tlong,11-Jun, don't see how your comment is relevant to my comment. :surprise: 
plekto,11-Jun," yeah.. as i've  toyota d numerous times before if you are that concerned with snow, just get 4x4 as it actually does work like it should. i can guarantee that my friend's  toyota  will outperform almost any awd system on almost any surface.but of course, it's big, expensive, and eats lots of gas and all of that... and you can't use the 4x4 mode on pavement. then again, you really don't need to given how well it drives.

ivan_99,11-Jun, i vote for a boat-car...imagine the possibilities.plus safety... 
plekto,11-Jun," heh.of course, i was being a little bit sarcastic there. :p but i think i also have a valid point in that if you are looking for a   ""  kia hyundai luxury performance sedan  ""  kia hyundai , awd is a minor concern compared to all of the other factors. because the fact is that most of them will be rwd or heavily rwd biased anyways. you will need winter tires if you want to drive it during the winter months.it just makes more sense to spend the extra $1500 on a second set of rims and winter tires and just swap them every 6 months or so. "
kdshapiro,11-Jun," none of these  car  are being raced at nascar. even the 750 comes with awd these days.meh i would rather go for the awd instead of a second set of rims. awd is more useful in more situations than two plus snows.10 years i probably would have been preaching being a pur toyota . now i just want to enjoy my ride and i don't care if i'm getting the last ounce of performance from it. or if the awd system is front biased, rear biased, full time or part time. i just don't want to get stuck.as an aside 4 snow tires on an awd car can out everything a rwd car in slick conditions. "
nyccarguy,11-Jun," i'm with you regarding awd. i've seen all the tests & read all the arguments. i know that a rwd car equipped with snow tires & all of today's electronic nannies will be lighter and therefore brake better & outmaneuver the exact same car with all season tires & awd. 2 of my 3  car  ('01  honda  & '10  acura ) are fwd and i equip them with 4 snow tires during the winter months. do the snow tires provide phenomenal grip & awesome traction in the white stuff? absolutely. are they perfect? no.changing over isn't that simple, nor is it cheap. my  honda  has a dedicated set of 15  ""  kia hyundai  steel wheels which the snow tires are mounted on. i store them where i work and have the changeover done by a   ""  kia hyundai fix-a-flat  ""  kia hyundai  place up the block. they charge me $30 each time i changeover. i didn't buy an extra set of wheels for my  acura , just a set of snow tires. i have to jam 3 tires into the trunk and put one in the front seat. my acura dealer charges $100 for a snow tire changeover that includes dismounting, remounting, & balancing.they don't plow particularly well where i live in stamford, ct (10 miles from the ny state border), nor do they salt due to the high concentration of well water. this past winter was particularly bad, but i can see how awd can and will be useful in the future.every bmw &    mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz   that's not an ///m (besides the x5 m & x6 m) or amg, 6, z4, sl, or slk is all wheel drive that i see in ny & ct.besides, my mere average driving skills won't let me squeeze the all out performance out of a rwd, sp equipped bmw anyway.

carnaught,11-Aug, how 'bout the  bmw  bmw? 
2233,11-Aug," the run flat tires are a deal breaker for me. i recently drove the 328xi and the x3. both were very nice. most posters say the run flats are loud, expensive, and do not handle as well as non run flats. most dealerships and tire stores do not stock run flats. if you get a flat tire, you can drive it 100 or so miles but it then must be replaced, not repaired. if you are several hundred miles from home, especially on a weekend, you will be stranded for up to 3 days waiting for the expensive tire to arrive at the dealer or tire store. you can change the tires to non run flats, but the storing of a spare could be problematic since no space is alloted for a spare.i would rate the  infiniti  first of the ones you mentioned. great handling, good looking, and very reliable. the tl would be the last vehicle i'd buy. i've owned 2 acuras but never again. the c class is nice but reliabilty  problem  are a concern.

qbrozen,11-Aug," i like the  infiniti x, but the horrible mileage is tough to live with. my  pontiac 5x could never get above 21mpg. i'm curious, though, why the  infiniti x vs the c300? a closer comparison would be the  infiniti  vs c300 or c350 vs  infiniti . personally, if awd is a must, i'd be looking at the  volvo , too.no big, heavy fwd  sedan  for me.

nyccarguy,11-Aug," it all depends on your driving style & what is important to you (performance, style, interior  toyota , features, trunk space, rear passenger space, driving  toyota mics...). especially if you are leasing, all the  car  you mentioned will be covered by their respective factory warranties for the duration of your lease (& probably beyond). reliability should pretty much a non-issue.  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  has been running some insanely cheap lease deals lately. especially on leftover 2011 c300 4matics (the most popular c around here).i'm a pretty big fan of  honda . we own 3. yes the tl is nose heavy & is front wheel drive, but acuras drive pretty nice. they are   ""  kia hyundai sporty.

2233,11-Aug," i would agree that the mileage on the g 37 is not great but you are driving a forced induction muscle car of sorts. on the  chevrolet way, i get 23 mpg.we have a 04  pontiac 5x and a 07  pontiac 5x. the exhaust on the 2004 is definitely loud but i hardly notice the exhaust on the newer 2007. i notice the exhaust more now that i replaced the tires with michelins on the 04. there is a clear difference in the newer gs re the exhaust sound. you may not even notice the exhaust on the new gs. i will probably buy an ex35 soon. i want something small with folding  seat . some consider this a  infiniti  with a little more storage. the ex is something to consider even though it is technically not a sedan but the smallest crossover on the market. infiniti has some nice incentives now.

qbrozen,11-Aug," it is not forced induction, fyi. forced induction means super dodge  or turbo dodge , of which the  infiniti  has neither. "
2233,11-Aug, you are correct. i misspoke re the forced induction. i've read numerous posts re forced induction mods on the g. i guess i meant to say that the g is a beast even without forced induction which several competitors use such as the bmw 335. 
shabadoo25,11-Aug, not driving a 3 series because of the tires is ludicrous. get an 08 or 09  bmw . 
2233,11-Aug," the abilities and liabilities of the tires are pretty important to most. there is no room for a spare in the x3 if you switch out the tires to non run flats. the interior of the current 3 series is very dated but the x3 interior is a huge improvement.there are many posters on the bmw sites that do not care for the run flats, although some do like the fact that they generally won't have to change a flat tire. getting stranded if you are out of state is a big concern in addition to the noise and poorer handling.that being  toyota d, i love the handling of the current 3 series. i actually considered the e91 until i saw the interior. it also has run flats.

2233,11-Aug," i may have m toyota akenly thought you were advocating run flats.another poster implied that german car companies other than bmw use run flats often. in fact, few other than bmw use only run flats. porsche had them years ago on the 959.  this site has arguments both ways for the run flats but the majority of these owners are against the use of them http://news.consumerreports.org/ car /2007/06/run-flat-tires-.htmli considered taking the run flats off a new x3 if i purchased one but there is no convenient place for the spare except taking up space in the smallish space behind the rear seat.they are loud, do not handle as well in the opinion of many, cost almost double, do not last as long and if is difficult to find them in stock.car makers should make the run flats optional.i like the  infiniti  of all the fine  car  mentioned here. it's probably the least expensive, has the great vq engine, is good looking, handles well, is reliable, and is rear wheel drive (or all wheel drive). the ride of the tl is a different type of ride which i do not like. i've owned several acuras but will never even consider these again due to their ongoing transmission issues.my second choice would be a current 3 series but i would ditch the run flats as soon as they wear out.....probably around 15,000. i'd replace them with michelins. the donut spare could fit in the trunk.

"
fedlawman,11-Aug," sorry, it's not that my research was poor, it's that you aren't following my logic. here, i'll spell it out...rejecting a bmw because you don't like the tires is akin to rejecting a porsche because the windows aren't tinted dark enough. and while it's true porsche's don't have run-flats, it's also true that 911's (and boxsters & caymans) don't come with a spare tire. off topic, but i thought you should know that there are 100's of thousands of drivers buying  car  in north america without a spare tire (no, not just porsche's -  chevrolet  does it too).

jerseyguy77,11-Sep," i've recently driven each of the  car  that are considered in this category and i can't yet make a decision. since this is my first foray into luxury i really didn't want to find myself regretting my choice in  car . i set out to look at the  acura , is250,  bmw ,  audi , &  infiniti . after reading some things i added the c300 to the l toyota , which you'll hear about. i am looking for people's input into my decision as i'm still unsure and i'd like to hear how you've liked the brand you chose and its cost to own. i'm scared about ending up with an endless pit of cash to maintain a car. and i'd rather not   ""  kia hyundai feel the road  ""  kia hyundai  which sounds redundant owning a small car but if i can feel every bump then i may as well buy another  toyota  and deal with the potholes in jersey. i was most hopeful going in about the is from lexus but found the car to be an exact duplicate of my current  toyota  from 2005. i hit my head on the roof while driving (i'm only 6ft tall) and i'm a big guy but the cabin felt c dodge ped. every time i talked to the salesman he acted like i was making a m toyota ake not buying a bigger car. do no salesman just l toyota en to what you're saying about preference? that car is now off the l toyota  and will remain there.i drove the  infiniti  and thought it was a very nice car. it felt   ""  kia hyundai classy  ""  kia hyundai  inside and, i guess sterile is the word that comes to mind. i actually liked it and liked that it was a bit bigger in the backseat than most in this group. i hate the idea that driving a small car means you can't drive more than 2 adults around. it was about $35 fully loaded with the backup camera and nav and awd, which is cheaper than the competitors. i didn't like the salesman (and his pushiness) but that won't totally sway my decision. i think it drove ok although not as well as the audi, bmw or the mb. additionally my mechanic loves these  car  and says they are the most reliable. i'm a bit unsure still though because i don't want nissan parts in my luxury car. its still on the l toyota . if i can't justify the extra $5k or so then i'll end up in  infiniti  if i had to guess.

plekto,11-Sep," your take on the  acura  is interesting as the same vehicle is sold in japan with an   ""  kia hyundai  honda   ""  kia hyundai  badge on it. it's an evolutionary design if anything and not a real new model. we get the top trim model  honda  sent over here and they slap some acura badges on it. hence why it's not really satisfying as a real luxury sport sedan. the is has the same problem in that it shows its  toyota  dna all too well.the  infiniti  as well can't hide the fact that it's a pimped-out  nissan .i'd also recommend taking a serious look at the cts. it's one of two vehicles that gm makes that are world-class. the rest? yes, it's typical bean-counting gm idiocy and blandness. i'd not recommend anything else they build. (the other vehicle is sold in australia, unfortunately).pros: cost to repair is less than the european models. about the same as the imports, which have crept up in price without most people noticing.ride is designed with u.s. drivers and roads in mind.(note - avoid the performance model as the tires are lower profile than necessary) it's a bit stiff as expected, but handles long road trips without any faults.the interior is very nice. who knew gm could actually make an interior that didn't suck? the nav system is actually very good. comparing the nav system in the   mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz mercedes-benz benz  to the cts is like comparing a tv dinner to real food. the cts? it just works.headroom and overall space is good. one thing about it that's great is that it's actually the same wheelbase size as a e class or 5 series, but the sheet metal is artfully done in such a way that it hides its size and looks a bit smaller. and as a bonus, it doesn't look like everyone else's jellybean. honestly, you can't tell a  infiniti  from a hyundai from a mazda from two blocks away.

markcincinnati,11-Sep," i wonder why you test drove the acura  acura  but not the acura tl. i am no expert in this field, but it seems to me the tl probably compares   ""  kia hyundai better  ""  kia hyundai  to an audi  audi , bmw 3, cadillac cts and infiniti g (etc, etc). after having owned 29 audis, i sent emails to dealers requesting quotes on an acura tl   ""  kia hyundai advance  ""  kia hyundai  awd, an audi  audi  prestige with sport package, an infiniti (also with several packages including sport awd), and a volvo  volvo  t6 with several packages to make it comparable to the audi/acura prestige/advance packages. i was planning to make my decision based on the best deal i could get on any one of these.although i did look at a  acura , it seemed a step down from the others i mentioned at the beginning of this post -- not a bad car, but more in line with an audi  audi  or perhaps an infiniti  infiniti  or a more basic version of some other car lines aspirational  car .a point is that, to me, all of the  car  in this class were contenders and i drove all of them (excluding the mb, why i can't recall). three of the  car  stood out as high performers (four, actually, but i'll get to that in a moment): the acura tl sh-awd advance, the audi  audi  prestige with sport package and 8-spd tiptronic and the volvo  volvo  t6 with several packages to increase its lux content levels to that of the audi and the acura. the fourth car that didn't make it to the finals was the  infiniti x s -- a car i wanted to want, since i am so impressed with my wife's 2011  infiniti /premium (to say nothing of the $1,000 loyalty bonus).the g didn't make it because it seemed so much smaller than the rest. i later figured out why -- it is less than 70  ""  kia hyundai  wide, and it just seems c dodge ped from behind the wheel. the tl, for instance is 74  ""  kia hyundai  wide and has a 63.8  ""  kia hyundai  track compared to the g's 60.2  ""  kia hyundai  track. i made my decision, after 29 audis in a row, based on price per month. i was ready to take (and i wanted) an audi  audi  first, the tl second and the volvo third. i test drove the heck out of the  car  (and i currently have a 2009 audi  audi  prestige sport) and determined that the audi remained my fave (but, just barely, as the other two were very close.) yet, both the acura and the volvo were so much more powerful and actually seemed larger than the audi, which was a plus since i often have my in-laws in the back seat.when all was  toyota d and done, the audi came in nearly $200 per month higher for 6 months longer than the acura and the volvo was about the same as the audi but for 36 months to the audi's 42.i took the lowest cost alternative -- and since it came in with the advance package it is, msrp wise, about the same as the audi, but has a 305hp engine, although it lacks the audis 8 speed transmission.having tested and previously having owned an audi s4, i came away thinking the acura tl sh-awd (what a mouthful) was   ""  kia hyundai somewhat closer  ""  kia hyundai  to an s4 than it is to an  audi , and for $11,500 less with similar content.sorry for the long story, but i think you should have at least tested the tl, it is a completely different car than the  acura , and seems like it would be less likely to be cross shopped with an  audi  or  infiniti , etc. the tl, on the other hand at $47,000 with   ""  kia hyundai the works  ""  kia hyundai  is about the same price and class as the  audi  and  infiniti  (and the cts for that matter.) in any case, in the entry level sport luxury class or whatever this is, most of these  car  are winners. :surprise: "

""  kia hyundai  we want more luxury features, we want more powerful engines, we want the sportiness. and stickiness of awd, we want our  car  to be quieter and we want the big shiny wheels -- 18-inchers are for sissies, we need 19's, 20's or even bigger (and heavier) ones. we want tires that have side-walls that are super-stiff (hence heavier tires) and we want every possible power amenity: power seat massagers and ventilated  seat  even. hell i don't want these things, i need them! doesn't everybody?i suppose abs and esp and brake ass toyota  weigh something -- but gawd, why have a car without that stuff (and i certainly want the other drivers to have these features, since they --- not me -- have become such dreadful drivers over the years.)so we're   ""  kia hyundai stuck  ""  kia hyundai  with ever heavier  car  -- because we want them, are required by law to have them and are, apparently, willing to pay for them.frankly, virtually any of the following: acura tl advance, audi  audi  prestige/sport (or s-line), bmw  bmw   bmw , cadillac cts/4 3.6 performance/luxury, infiniti  infiniti x/s or volvo  volvo  t6 would be welcome in my garage -- the fact that after 29 audis in a row i bought a tl was simply that the damn thing came in nearly $200 less per month than the car i wanted, a 2011 audi  audi  prestige/sport. that and the 19  ""  kia hyundai  wheels and tires and a very sweet and smooth 305hp engine. oh yea, and an even better sound system than the b&o system found in the audi (and that is saying something.)i may find, as some suggest here, that the acura will ultimately prove to be unexciting, uninspiring and prone to rattles and premature leather wear (on the  seat ). residual values suggest otherwise, but i don't even have 1,000 miles on the acura yet, so i am not a reliable or experienced witness.anyway, kwitcherbitchin', the  car  are heavy, heavier, heaviest mostly because we want them that way (or at least most of us do.) :surprise: "

shipo,11-Sep," like it or don't, if you want a car with in excess of 300 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque, you'll also need to buy a car with a heavier engine and drive-train. throw just the engine from the  bmw  into a  bmw  (a process which will bump the weight in and of itself), and just watch what happens to the rest of the drive-train. not pretty.as has been stated here before, between the regulated in safety features and the market demand for larger and more powerful  car , it is physically impossible to build a relatively inexpensive sedan with the size, safety and performance of a  bmw  for anywhere near 3,200 pounds.

markcincinnati,11-Sep," thanks for the congrats -- here is the buying story.i found a website called carwoo.com -- which, for a one time fee, allows you to locate and price a car without revealing your identity. unlike competing web sites that do essentially the same thing, carwoo takes money only from the buyer, not from the seller (unless, of course they are lying.) i paid $148 which allowed me to send queries to every audi, acura, infiniti and volovo dealer in ohio, kentucky and indiana. i limited my selection to the dealers under 200 miles away from cincinnati.carwoo allows you to configure the car exactly as you want it and you get a text box to explain any flexibility you may have or anything you will not consider.you then press a button and wait about 24 hours for the carwoo email machine to start sending you links to your carwoo account with offers from dealers.to make a long story a bit shorter, volvo responded quickly and would not budge off of a $1,000 off msrp discount. bzzz! thanks for playing, maybe next time.infiniti was pretty aggressive and two dealers offered me prices that almost had me saying yes.audi dealers responded, oddly, (all of them) saying they had no inventory and that any  audi  would have to be ordered. one of them finally gave me a price but it was for 42 months, not 36 or 39 and it began with a $7 (for a sub $48,000  audi  for pity's sake).acura, locally, came in at best, with a 6.5% discount off msrp (columbia). a columbus ohio dealer -- lindsay acura -- came in at 13% off msrp for a 2012 acura tl sh-awd advance with backup sensors (which are about a $715 accessory.) here's the funny thing, they sourced the car from columbia -- i have the window sticker! whatsupwiththat?!?the car was $499 per month + tax.i had driven all of the  car  (not a lexus or mb of any kind) multiple multiple times and really liked the  audi  (what's not to like i still have my 2009 for another 30 days?), the  bmw 7x and the tl sh-awd (advance model). likewise i thought the volvo  volvo  t6 was great fun! i also had a chance to drive a premium+ audi s4 (without the sport diff -- aka no torque vectoring.) now that car was the most fun of all (but in premium+ mode had much less   ""  kia hyundai content  ""  kia hyundai  than the other  car  i had tested, plus is was mo' money, big time.)truth be told in what was nearly a back to back to back experience, i drove the audi, the cadillac and the acura over the exact same route for about the exact same time, speeds, tunes on the sound system, etc, etc, in one day's worth of test drives.i am hoping not to receive a bunch of   ""  kia hyundai are you out of your mind  ""  kia hyundai  posts, but i will  toyota  to say this -- the acura tl sh-awd advance is very close in performance and overall   ""  kia hyundai character  ""  kia hyundai  to an audi s4 -- and although very nice and perhaps   ""  kia hyundai dressier,  ""  kia hyundai  the cadillac cts/4 3.6 with the 19  ""  kia hyundai  wheel performance option was the least inspiring of the bunch.now the acura tl sh-awd advance is no audi s4, i am not saying it is, the s4 would be the winner, but contented to match the acura was just shy of $12,000 more and i could not muster the one that i drove (which was not contented thusly) into and out of corners that much quicker than i could the acura (which may have had an advantage over the audi at the time since the acura had torque vectoring and the the audi did not. moreover, the audi did seem more prone to wallowing through corners as if it had more understeer than the acura, which, even though it was slower seemed perhaps better balanced than the audi.so, i says to myself, the acura (as equipped to my tastes) was just under $48,000 (including shipping, but excluding tax), and my price was about $8,000 off of that -- thank you carwoo.com.no one else even came close.remember i was pricing an  audi  2.0t prestige 8-spd tip w/sport package and wood which came in pretty close msrp wise to the acura. the cadillac had attractive offers but other than its glizt left me thinking it was not  ford sed on performance as much as the other guys. and, the cadillac had one thing missing that, for me, was a deal breaker -- a $53,000 cts does not have grab handles for the front seat passenger or driver. all the other guys do -- and i consider them essential, basic, standard, normal and required. how much do grab handles cost anyway -- in a $53,000 car, maybe $50? what were they thinking? and, moreover, cadillac in the 4-door cts does not even offer a blind spot warning system -- which came standard on both the audi and the acura at the trim levels i spec'd.so, thus far, i am missing the audi new car smell, i miss automatic windshield wipers and bi-xenons (but i rarely can turn on my high beams, so that is not that big of a deal) -- and, oddly enough, i miss the audi needle sweep when i start the acura up.then, i get on the highway and press my foot down, arousing a 305hp 274 pound feet of torque super smooth engine, watch the power shift from the front to the rear wheels and, zip, i'm at 80mph in a d toyota ance that seems not much longer than my driveway.loving the cooled  seat  and the best sound system i have ever heard in any car (including the b&o in audi which had been my previous fave.)having  toyota d all of this -- i probably still would have gone with the audi 2.0t prestige sport if it had come in at a price to match the acura.money talks, as the saying goes. . . :surprise: "

markcincinnati,11-Sep," i am pretty well convinced that my 2012 tl will outperform my 2009  audi  2.0t, too. the audi, which has audi drive select, can be put into   ""  kia hyundai  toyota mic  ""  kia hyundai  mode and that makes the steering more responsive and the dampers more firm and the transmission shift at higher speeds. it has 19  ""  kia hyundai  wheels with ultra high performance yoko s.advan (?) all-season tires (35% aspect ratio).it has rear wheel drive biased  audi  and last but not least has 211hp and 258 lb ft of torque with the power going through a 6 speed automatic   ""  kia hyundai tiptronic  ""  kia hyundai  transmission.it, the audi that is, is and has been great fun to drive and it is confidence inspiring to the max.the tl isn't quite as hunkered down feeling, but it is wider and has about a 1  ""  kia hyundai  shorter wheelbase. it is nose heavier than the audi (but not a whole lot), rides on similar tires (but not ultra high performance) of 40% aspect ratio is front biased awd, but also includes torque vectoring. it feels a bit softer than the  audi , it is quieter and feels a bit larger -- but it has 305hp and 274 lb feet of torque, and when properly applied when cornering, the damn thing seems to be able to magically go from a nose heavy understeering blob, to an oversteering (slightly) taught, tight curve carver.the audi probably can cut the corners about at the same speeds, or maybe higher than the acura, even without torque vectoring -- but when coming out of the curve the 305hp allows the acura to always show the audi its tail lights. my audi, all in, was $49k (msrp) the acura, just south of $48k -- at these prices power rules. and, overall the acura is a very nice place to spend some time either behind the wheel or as a passenger enjoying the ventilated  seat  (that the audi lacks). toyota d it before, irrational as it might be, if the audi were the same lease price per month as the acura (that is about $200 less), i would have gone with another audi -- just for that special something that only a german car seems to offer.irrational.couldn't see the price per month delta though and that seems rational. i am overall quite pleased with the acura and if they continue to improve and move forward and keep their value prop, well, i could become a true believer. you know, though, any of these  car  are pretty damn nice. :surprise: "
graphicguy,11-Sep," you know, though, any of these  car  are pretty damn nice. that....we absolutely agree upon!your tl, my 3, the audis....all of them do amazing things, as they should, at the price points they sell at.they do so  toyota mically,  toyota ably.....i know i averaged about 21 mpg on my tl sh awd. i'm averaging about 24 mpg on my  bmw  (which  honda s me even more). i don't baby my  car , either.these  car  have come far. "
nyccarguy,11-Sep," graphicguy & markincincinati - i think the 2 major things you'll both notice that are different between your current & former tl sh awd & current bmw & audi are:steering. having never driven a tl sh awd, just my 2010  acura , i can tell you the electric power steering stinks. road feel is non-ex toyota ant at low speeds. at higher speeds it is really nice and tight though. brakes. there is a reason that my  acura  is less expensive than pretty much every other car in this segment. acura honda had to cut corners somewhere. the brakes on my  acura  are terrible. nothing at all like bmw's right now brakes with their incredible pedal firmness & physics defying stopping ability.obviously power is different too. mark's acura is definitely faster than his former  audi , while graphicguy's 335 has the ability to outrun pretty much 90% of the normal  car  on the road  "
tlong,11-Sep," i had a 1998  audi  (6 cyl) and have an '05 tl. differences between the two:- tl has more electronic goodies (but 7 year newer car)- tl poorer handler, wallows in turns- tl's climate control much quieter- audi interior clearly nicer- audi control feel and driving feel clearly better- audi  honda d much more passion- audi extremely expensive to maintain, the few things that broke were a lot- acura has been outstandingly reliable and cheap to maintain "
sweendogy,11-Sep," breaks are not the only thing that makes the acura  acura  less expensive. 4 vtek which is in every other honda product prob being the biggest saver of money for the acura car, lets not forget the  honda  platform. its not really a sports sedan but more of a sporty sedan, as 90% of them are sold with automatics. (same thing with the tl, nice rig for sure but not a true sports sedan- even in sh-awd form) closest to the germans is infiniti by far-- rear wheel drive, good breaks, sports packages, manual transmissions (which are sadly going away) .  car  from the far east are closer then they have ever been but its going to be interesting to see what car companies do in the upcoming years as they need to keep up with mpg mandates - i know bmw will be bringing a 4cy to the states soon, acura can use the turbo 4 it already produces, infiniti will team with mb for its next line of engines, should be interesting. "
nyccarguy,11-Sep," i might be m toyota aken, but off the top of my head the only other honda product that uses the exact same motor (2.4l - 201 hp - 176 lb/ft torque) is the  honda  si.i'll agree with you that under extreme circumstances, my  acura  shows it's  honda  platform roots. we have some seriously tw toyota y back roads here in southwestern connecticut. there's one particular road where the sign shows   ""  kia hyundai s  ""  kia hyundai  curves for 1 mile with a 15 mph suggested speed limit. my  acura  shows the flaws in it's chassis.like many here have  toyota d, price aside, i'd choose a bmw.every single car in this segment shines in it's own way. a 3 series equipped like my  acura  (or even a tl) costs significantly more, has a smaller back seat, & a smaller trunk. the 3 series is sharper, handles better, drives much better overall.

billyperksii,11-Sep, still putting down acuras but always inquiring about the next generation tl.its either you love the brand or just shop somewhere else. 
markcincinnati,11-Sep," . . .i can tell you that the acura is not an audi (doh!) but as mine is equipped (2012 tl sh-awd advance package), it is a capable car. believable as an el luxury performance sedan -- totally believable. it would be more believeable if acura had chosen the best available ultra high performance a/s shoes instead of the   ""  kia hyundai ok  ""  kia hyundai  goodyear rs-a's. my 2009 audi  audi  was special ordered with the sport package, which at the time included 19  ""  kia hyundai  35 series max performance dunlops, sport  seat  and 3 spoke sport steering wheel with paddle shifters, and a lowered and stiffened suspension. i also configured mine with a $3,000 option called audi drive select which would actually further stiffen the ride via firming the shocks when you pressed  toyota mic mode.i was given, many times, 2009, 2010 and 2011  audi  premium plus versions as loaners -- none of them had sport packages or audi drive select.a new  audi , even in prestige dress (but without the sport package option or sline and audi drive select), feels softer and demonstrates greater body roll than my new tl. a new  audi  minus the sport package lacks the bolstered  seat  (which the tl has) and any attempt to throw the car into curves causes your butt to slip slide away and the  audi  in standard suspension trim demonstrates a fair amount of body roll. meanwhile the tl grips you as you accelerate hard whilst in a corner and the torque vectoring makes the car damn near pivot through the corner. the tl is not an  audi  and it is, duh, also not an s4. however when talking about these  car ' abilities in the tw toyota ies, the tl behaves more like an  audi  with the sline or sport package and pulls hard enough to   ""  kia hyundai allow you to imagine  ""  kia hyundai  imagine you are feeling the urge that accompanies pressing the accelerator of an s4 way south. in other words, the tl is caught somewhere between an  audi  2.0t prestige with the sport package and audi drive select and an s4 prestige with the sport differential.given a magic wand, i would have the s4 prestige with ads+sport diff -- in a hearbeat.but, without magic, the $12,000 difference (that the s4 commands) tends to change one's mind.this time, even the  audi  2.0t prestige w/sport priced me out of the audi market -- especially after i had driven the tl advance back to back with a 2011  audi  (which, admittedly did not have the sport package.)that it takes -- essentially -- a $50,000+ audi  audi  sline (mine lacked sline trim bits) to subjectively feel as performance oriented as the tl advance, says something about acura -- yet, at this point in my experience (1,000 miles), i'm not exactly sure what that something is.the next gen tl is probably the one to make me a repeat and perhaps long-term believer or make me somehow  hyundai  up the coin for another audi. :surprise: "
flightnurse,11-Sep," not too sure what people in this forum have been smoking,why are you talking about a s4 and a acura tl together??? not even close in comparison... not too sure even if i would compare the  audi  to a tl since the tl is a bigger car with more interior volume. what i find interesting is, it appears audi has dropped the sport package from the  audi  line up, not too sure if that was a smart move for them.

nyccarguy,11-Sep," markincincinnati & graphicguyfunny how the 3 of us are at opposite ends of the financial spectrum in our lives, yet have similar tastes & tolerances when it comes to  car .the  seat  in my  acura  is one thing that i absolutely love! they are thickly bolstered, firm, & super  toyota able. they do a fantastic job keeping my narrow, 150 lb rear end from sliding around during aggressive handling maneuvers.the main thing that fueled the purchase of my  acura  was fuel economy. back in august 2009 i had a 1990 bmw 325i i bought about a year earlier that wouldn't pass ny state inspection & my trusted mechanic told me i should either find a new engine or start paying him to tear the car's inline 6 apart to find out what was wrong. cash 4 clunkers came about and i realized my car qualified for a $3500 rebate. i was also going to need a car in the next year because the lease on our 2007 x3 was going to end & we were in danger of going way over our 45,000 allotted miles. so i wanted a car that drove great, had a roomy back seat (for our 2 child safety  seat ), & a generously sized trunk (to accommodate our double stroller).i headed straight to an audi dealer to drive an  audi  avant. i drove a premium model & thought it was ok, nothing special. i was also frightened at the prospect of owning an audi for the long haul. i went an drove a mini cooper s clubman which i didn't like. a very awkward car. lots of blindspots. lifeless and very disconnected electric power steering. ru toyota ery shifter. clutch with a high take up point.i then stopped by an acura dealer, drove the  acura  &  toyota d to myself, i really like this car. it drives like a 4 door version of my 2001  honda  type sh. it is by no means perfect, but for the price, it rocks. i've got 2 sons (5 & 2 1/2) and a daughter on the way in early december.  car  are expensive (especially the ones i like). right now i do too much driving ( acura  is 2 years old & has over 40k, while  honda  is 4 months old with 7,000 miles) to lease. leasing is also very expensive. nor can i afford to buy cash & trade every 2-3 years.i plan to pay off my car loans in 5 years & keep them for at least 10 years (assuming no mechanical catastrophies or god forbid accidents) so we can (re)build our savings towards retirement & our children's college educations.i've owned exclusively new  car  since i got my license at 16 (besides my e30 bmw which was a project car). i love the way  bmw  drive so much that if something happens to my acura, i'd look for a cpo bmw 335 with the n55 in a heartbeat.

fedlawman,11-Sep," nyc,graphicguy makes some good points. i'm about 10 years ahead of you too...my daughter will get her learner's permit next year and i've already started teaching her how to drive a stick on the weekends (yes, in the  bmw !). the family  toyota mic will change permanently when she starts driving.we got the v70 with 3rd row almost 8 years ago and it's been a great family hauler, but when my daughter starts driving, we have some choices to make. keep the wagon and give it to her?also, my wife hates the  bmw  - refuses to drive it except as a last resort. i've started thinking that it's selfish of me to keep it around if i'm the only one who is ever going to drive it. plus, i have a company car for work, so i only drive the m on weekends or when the sun's out and i get a hankering. it sits in the garage with a trickle  dodge  for most of the winter.so we could keep the volvo and sell the  bmw . let my daughter use the volvo and get a 911 or 135i or something for me and my wife to share.we could sell the volvo and the  bmw  and get a 135i plus a subaru  subaru .we could keep both the volvo and the  bmw  and get a 3rd car like a  ford  or  chevrolet  for my daughter.whatever we decide, there are definitely some confusing issues with the changing family  toyota mic and the car market.  car  are crazy expensive now and like you (and others here), the  car  i like are expensive. i would rather not spend $50k on a car, but nothing i have looked at that i like costs less than $40k.i was a new car buyer for many years too, but since i started driving bmw's (my e30 325i was my first one 7 years ago), i can't help thinking there's no value in it. i might try a cpo car next to add some value to the process.whatever we decide, trading and buying a new car every 3 years is definitely out. i love the fact that the volvo is paid for and 8 years old, and my wife stills loves the car. the volvo experience has taught me to buy the most car i can afford and keep it as long as possible.

flightnurse,11-Sep," interesting, having driven a couple of s4 myself and a new tl-sh awd i thought the s4 was by far the better car, the audi did not lean as much as the tl in corners and i thought the  audi  system was set up for more rear wheel bias then the acrua. i also thought the acrua didn't have the low end grunt that the audi had too. however the looks of the acrua even after a mid refresh to me is just ugly, its hard to beat the audis in looks and overall design.

markcincinnati,11-Sep," well, having driven both the s4 and the tl back to back, i can say they are close, if you don't consider the price -- the tl is, imho, kind of an audi as4, if such an animal actually was available from audi. of the audi s4 and acura tl, automobile magazine  toyota d:  ""  kia hyundai if it seems like neither car can pull an advantage here without the other catching up, you've been paying attention. the final equalizer is that, comparably equipped, the audi costs nearly $11,500 more than the acura. that kind of money can buy the tl a serious brake upgrade. but the price difference isn't much of a factor here, since we've never actually heard of someone cross-shopping a tl and an s4.

markcincinnati,11-Oct," short answer, no. at this point, an audi  audi  2.0t prestige + sline with everything on it except ads would be a great car. i have ads, i have, currently both a 2009  audi  prestige + sport pakage (that has ads) and a 2012 acura tl advance.in 2009 but not in 2011 or 2012 audi  audi  2.0t prestige + sport or sline packages, i see less of a need for the $3,000 ads option due to the fact that the new  audi 's can be had with an 8-speed tiptronic that comes with sport shift and in sport package or sline configuration comes with a lowered sport suspension and sport  seat  and a sport steering wheel with paddle shifters.in other words, today, i would not get an  audi  2.0t prestige + sline, w/ 8 speed tiptronic and  hyundai  up for the ads.another reason i would not get this option today: on the  audi , torque vectoring is not an option (yet). i would pay for the ads -- on an  audi  -- if it came with tv.the s4, at $50,000 is content poor compared with a $47k tl advance -- but the s4 can be had with tv, under the name sport differential. i believe to get tv, however, one needs to buy ads (on the s4.) the total additional cost to get both ads+sport differential is, as i recall, about $4,500.the s4 i would want would have to be contented to the tl advance level, and that requires that the s4 be configured not as a premium plus, but as a prestige model.if you do all of this to an s4, its msrp is some $12,000 more than the acura tl advance with backup sensors (which is how i have mine configured.)now, having  toyota d all of this, i would rather have the s4 than the tl. moreover, i would have, at the time, gone with a 2012 audi  audi  2.0t prestige+sline without ads, if the price on a 36 month lease was comparable to the acura lease (the msrp's would have been very close to each other so configured.)i should stipulate, that to save a bit, i would be fine with the  audi  2.0t prestige 8-speed tiptronic version with either sport package or sline, and i know the sport package would have been somewhat less money than sline, which, for the price difference only includes trim differences not suspension or other performance inducing differences.in any case, my decision was not based on which car i thought was the best -- i went with the one (this time) that i thought was the best value. the tl advance (with the oddly optional back up sensors @ $725) filled that bill very nicely. my lease on the tl for 36 months was about $150 per month less than the lease on the audi  audi  (prestige, sport, etc, etc) for 42 months. at 36 months (apples to apples) the audi was about $200 per month more than the tl which, although it ain't no audi, is -- for $200 per month less -- a fine imitation.i've had 29 audis, since 1977. i have been to the ingolstadt factory for the how they build 'em tour, 6 times. i have participated in 4 audi driving schools in seefeld, austria (and won one of them -- fastest time through the course.) i, for a number of years, would bleed little interconnected rings when cut. audi of america sent me to st. moritz along with 49 other of their   ""  kia hyundai top 50  ""  kia hyundai  north american customers for the audi sponsored women's downhill ski cup event.and, i bought one of the first  audi 's in 1997 (ordered in 1996 and waited 11 months) after audi sent my dealership a euro-spec  audi  and asked the dealer to loan it to his top customers for 24 hours (undoubtedly a ploy to make the star struck customers order up a new  audi  -- which i did.)if the above doesn't qualify me at some level to judge or at least opine about the differences and similarities between an acura tl advance and an audi  audi  or s4, i don't know what else does.if i could somehow have been convinced that the audi was not just incrementally better than the acura, but substantially better, i would have probably gone with the 2012 audi  audi  2.0t prestige sline w/8-speed tip. but after driving two audis, an  audi  and an s4 (2011's and the  audi  did not have the sport package -- or sline, and the s4 was what is simply called premium plus and it did not have the sport differential) then driving a cadillac cts/4 with the 19  ""  kia hyundai  wheel sport package (2011) and then the acura tl advance, i thought the acura tl was most like an s4 than it was an  audi  or a cts.i also drove a volvo  volvo  t6, an infiniti  infiniti x/s and an infiniti  bmw 7x premium+tech, and an acurca zdx tech. while my '09  audi  was in for service i also had been loaned a 2011 audi  audi  3.0t premium plus for a day.every one of these  car  were test driven (and i was video'd by my wife whilst i was driving and giving a running commentary) over the exact same route, the sound systems were tested with the exact same cd's/tunes (wecome to the machine, pink floyd; how dare you, 10cc; and, new  nissan , donald fagen.)so, i offer up for your consideration: the audi, acura, cadillac, infiniti and volvo are all great  car  and more alike than different, generally speaking. i wouldn't kick any of them out of bed for eating crackers, and i'd even bring the crackers.you can argue that the audi is the prettiest (which it is) and the acura the ugliest (well, hell, that's true too -- even though it is less ugly for 2012), the cadillac is the   ""  kia hyundai blingy-est  ""  kia hyundai  (no doubt) and the infiniti's remain the japanese bmw's, while the volvo is the most unexpected -- and delightful to drive -- car of the bunch.the acura does excel in one area: it has the best damn factory sound system i have ever heard.and, for me, an almost s4 at the price of an acura tl advance sh-awd, is a no-brainer.drive it like you live -- i'll say it again, these are all very nice  car  and all deserve your consideration if you are in the $40 - $50k market.i am, for the next two days driving a new acura  acura  which is the loaner car i was given while my tl has the back up sensors grafted to the rear bumper -- it too is a   ""  kia hyundai nice car,  ""  kia hyundai  but compared to the others in this edmunds category, it seems like it is out of place, or perhaps, out of its class.that's my story and i'm stickin' to it.

tlong,11-Oct," i have owned both audi and acura. i tend to agree that for a big price, the audi is generally a nicer car. but your post is biased based upon irrelevant criteria, imho.   ""  kia hyundai  car  developed for the autobahn  ""  kia hyundai  - all of these car companies are selling worldwide and all need to meet various needs of different countries, whether that be suspension tuning or emissions or left/right side drive. some  honda s in fact are developed in the usa. germans develop  car  in the us, gm develops  car  in europe and china and australia. it's quite simpl toyota ic to assume that parent country of origin = where the car is developed.

sweendogy,11-Oct," i love the illustrations but they prove little but you did point out that acura/honda did have a good past stable of sports  car  but as you know the  honda  hasnt been produced since 2005 the s2000 was 09... now given the fact that those 2  car  were rwd and were light weight and were great handlers - something the tl and  acura  are not. - is the  audi  a sports sedan->- well thats a great question-- i think in 6speed form with the turbo and awd with the sports package it could be. but i think audi has moved the car into the main honda  to compete vs the tl's and es's -but in the past with the 2.0 or 1.8 turbo and 6speed for sure it was. the s4/s5 for sure are. the newer car has put on some weight and to get an audi with fwd for me audi is stupid.the  acura  is not sporty because of its platform as stated before --its an  honda  which is a great car but just not sporty. the  volkswagen  in standard for is not close to the  acura  but in gli form its more of a sportie sedan then the  acura -(plus its cheaper)- same amt of power.. both have put on weight, but the gli would be a sportier option given the fact they offer a quick dsg transmission. same one thats in the  volkswagen . the  volkswagen  r will offer the vr6 in 2012 and get to 60 in 5.5 seconds or about 2.2 seconds quicker then the manual  acura  (which only 10% of buyers would get).funny you bring this up -- i leased a acura gs-r and in 2004 had to return it and i considered the  acura , which i liked in manual form ... but i drove the vr6  volkswagen  gli and saved 4k.edmunds tests the gli vs the  acura ...http://www.insideline.com/volkswagen/ volkswagen /2006/2005-acura- acura -vs-2006-volkswage- n- volkswagen -gli-comparison-test.htmlheres my favorite line   ""  kia hyundai as much as we liked the refinement of the acura, the gli's performance makes it the better sport sedan  ""  kia hyundai good read, eh - i like your passion but again i think we should move this car off the board..i love the track pixs but stay out of the left lane.

"
fedlawman,11-Oct," you and i fundamentally think differently about  car .in my opinion, a sports car is a sports car based on its dna, not it's horsepower or amount of traction or it's pedigree.i don't believe that the base  audi  (a regular car) magically becomes a sports car because you increase the horsepower or add traction. i don't agree that the   ""  kia hyundai regular  ""  kia hyundai   volkswagen  is a family car and the gli is a sport sedan.does the mini require a super dodge  to be considered a sports car?none of the  car  in this segment are   ""  kia hyundai sports  car .

sweendogy,11-Oct," i guess your right a sports car should weigh 3500-4000 lbs and have less the 200 hp and fwd. - the  acura  is a sporty car when it's paired with the 6 speed.i drive the 04  acura  and it has the best manual transmission in the segment by far but it's not fast, it handles good for a front driver but it's not a sports car. and the fact that the current acura sales demographic is closer to buick then bmw. now i agree that a true sports sedan has prob died due to current weight of the group we speak of. now for you to disagree with me is fine but what about the edmunds article that declared the  volkswagen  gli better then your  acura  ? and you are right your  acura  could stay with a 325 but the current  acura  could not stay with the current 328 and i think that's my point, current acura models just can't compete because they never evolve.

fedlawman,11-Oct," i've never driven a  volkswagen  gli so i can't comment on it. i think it's (a lot) smaller than the  acura  and doesn't have as many amenities and has a less refined driveline though - not a near-luxury segment car. i do really like last years cockpit lighting and layout though - very upscale for an economy car.the  acura  weighs less than any version of the  audi  audi makes. it's also lighter than the  infiniti  and is250. and honda's i-4 makes similar power to both of those competitors v-6 motors. the  acura  is also the epitome of a smooth refined driveline. the switchgear/cockpit ergonomics and quality is maybe a notch below audi but certainly as good as or better than infiniti, lexus, and bmw.plus, if you do own a 2004  infiniti   acura , then you know the joy of revving that honda i-4 up to 7400 rpm - only bmw's  acura ary i-6 is as satisfying to wind up.and talk about keeping pace - the  acura  has soldiered on with the same specs for 8 years and infiniti comes out with a brand new car that offers a mere 17 more hp and weighs almost 200 lbs more?!?! acura must be doing something right to  honda  infiniti and lexus to build such close competitors.every car in this segment has an achilles heel. the  acura  is the least expensive car here, and it offers a lot of ellps for the money. but if you want more than 200hp, then obviously it's not the right choice.

sweendogy,11-Oct," govt mpg mandates have a lot to do with why infiniti and soon bmw are taking down hp. i dont think it has anything to do with acura inspiration. now i know the  acura  offers little more then you can get in a standard  honda  except an extra year on the warantee and an acura badge, sure it has nice leather innards but the ergonomics are subject to personal taste. , as edmunds stated in the article the gli slightly beats it as a sport car. i know the sweet vtexh and it's great action manual (whicjlh i hope stays)- but the  acura  has only gotten fatter over the years - with no power boost - 90% of them are automatics and it's currently sitting in a stale stable. i'm looking for a recent article that mentions this car as being a sports sedan, one published in the last 3 years.

fedlawman,11-Oct, so you seriously believe that the  honda  and  hyundai  are ellps's? 
fedlawman,11-Oct," you know, i remember the discussion when the  acura  first came out in 2003. back then, it was the mazd audi  owners who challenged that the  acura  wasn't a   ""  kia hyundai luxury  ""  kia hyundai  car and the mazd audi  was superior because it had   ""  kia hyundai similar amenities  ""  kia hyundai  and a more powerful v6 (a recurring theme...).well, there is the difficult to articulate quality of precision, refinement, and craftsmanship that the  acura  possesses in spades that more pedestrian  car  lack.all you have to do is sit behind the wheel of the  hyundai  and you immediately know it is an economy car. one drive and you instantly feel that lack of chassis and driveline refinement.the  honda  is another beast altogether. the  honda  is arguably   ""  kia hyundai luxurious  ""  kia hyundai  enough to compare with the bottom of the ellps class. it does lack some features expected here like xenon headlights, driver memory settings, etc., but more importantly, it lacks a sporting character. it is a big car - softly sprung with flat  seat . the precision and refinement are there, but it doesn't have the  toyota mics of a sport sedan.yes, you could go online and get summer tires, sway bars, springs/struts and make it a handler, but then what you would have is a large, slushbox equipped, harsh riding family car (last year, i equipped my volvo with bilsteins and know first-hand what a disaster that was!).so why try to shoehorn the  honda  into a category it wasn't designed or suited for when honda already makes a car that is the epitome of the ellps segment? a nimble, fun, refined sedan that has a terrific engine and gearbox with a modicum of luxury?

m6user,11-Oct," acura does offer a manual in both the  acura  and tl which i think is great.. but less then 10% of total  car  sold-- mainly because the real car drivers are not shopping acura just what percent of  bmw ,  audi s, c300s, gs etc etc are sold with manual trannies? i'm pretty sure it's very close to the percentage you attribute to   ""  kia hyundai non-sports  ""  kia hyundai   car . just because they are offered doesn't mean that they sell that many. i think i read somewhere that even bmw is only about 10% sticks. i don't think that manual transmission buy rates should be the determining factor as you keep saying over and over and over again. i also know some pretty darn good car drivers that don't drive sticks for a variety of reasons and certainly not because they can't drive well. as far as the  acura  goes, there has to be a entry point to this category and one person is hardly the authority. edmunds, when comparing to the  volkswagen ,  toyota d it wasn't as good a sport car or something like that. but, they did put it in the same category. "
sweendogy,11-Oct, ok but again where is the proof that this car should be here- anything published besides your thoughts would be of great value- the car rags or anything that can substanciate your claim- lets be serious here- the  acura  is a great entry level car for someone who is looking for value luxury not sports sorry.. i love the fact that you guys are defending this once great value but again when compared to its true comp its not really the value it once was. now if you include acura as a brand behind this car it validates my claim - they are nowhere when it comes to sport. they are behind every other major comp in almost every category and have been happy for years being an ok (middle of the road) company. 
m6user,11-Oct," a better question would be why do you have such a vendetta against it? acura, as a brand, may have gone astray of some their sportier past models but that doesn't change the  acura  that much at least any more than other brands have grown and gotten heavier. acura is a luxury or a near luxury brand.  acura  is it's entry level offering and it's a sedan. the only questionable operative word in the title of this thread then would be performance which is somewhat subjective. so for you to set the bar is quite assuming it seems. "
cdnpinhead,11-Oct," is this ever going to end?people who own or have driven the 1st gen  acura  seem very pleased with it. one or two people who haven't seem to have a near-psychotic problem with it.it's just a car. these days anything with a manual transmission is 80% of the way to being a sports sedan. there aren't many anymore.the last time i remember things getting this weird was when there was a board on here called   ""  kia hyundai bmw  bmw  or pontiac  pontiac  gtp,  ""  kia hyundai  where people who were totally invested their personal opinions went on for years (well, maybe it was months, but it seemed like years). there was a gm fanboi who just kept on and kept on and kept on.oh well. . .

sweendogy,11-Oct, well the board is to talk about entry level luxury performance  sedan  which i feel and have shown by reviews and sales figures that it does not belong here in its current state. others have given personal thoughts but nothing concrete on why it belongs here- i like facts over subjective comments to prove a point.and i'm spent. 
tlong,11-Oct, ok but again where is the proof that this car should be here...trying to prove a subjective judgement is silly. and citing car magazines (which are also subjective judgments) isn't much better. the fact that we aren't sure means it should probably be in the discussion.

nyccarguy,11-Oct," a large percentage of any of these  car  are leased. you can't go by the manual transmission take rate to decide whether or not any particular car belongs in this category. the take rate for manual transmissions in the usa in general is probably less than 10%.people lease for 4 reasons:business reasons where they can take some sort of tax deduction.they can afford to & like to be in a new car every 2-3 years.leasing is used as an alternative method of financing that works quite well if you can live within mileage limitations.people lease to get a more expensive car at a cheaper payment. many of these people do not understand leasing and shouldn't be doing it.there are tons of leased  acura s, tls, 328s, 335s,  audi s, is 250s... among others in my area. i was nyccarguy a long time ago in a  ford  far, far away. i fled the  honda  back in '04 for westchester county & moved to stamford, ct last year. not long "
rayainsw,11-Oct," some details:  day 1 &#150; friday 16 sept. &#150; delivery & drive to krimml, austria: we cleared customs and collected our checked bags without incident. service on the flight was excellent, and the food [ 2 meals ! ] was quite good. [lufthansa  audi 40-600.]  we met rolf [ retired bmw employee ] at the designated spot and he drove us [ in his bmw diesel wagon ] first to the local bmw dealer in munich and across the street to acquire several excellent local maps and the toll vignettes [ stickers ] required in austria and in switzerland, then delivered us to the welt. just in time to watch the 11am &#145;motorcycle on the stairs&#146; show. interesting. rolf charges a very reasonable fee, and it was great to just try to sit back and relax [ after a 6.5 hour flight from boston ] while he drove and talked. we filled out the required paperwork and the customer service rep. recited a l toyota  of potentially useful information &#150; most of which i had seen before on various forums. he was quite efficient and cordial &#150; and answered a few of our questions. the reminder about &#145;no right turn on red&#146; was quite handy &#150; as this was something i had to keep reminding myself about all trip long. and i was cautioned again that switzerland traffic police allowed no violation of their speed limits &#150; period. noted.  we had about 45 minutes until our scheduled orientation and background presentation, so we sampled various goodies in the &#147;premier lounge&#148;. very nicely done & convenient &#150; high above & overlooking the vehicle delivery area. we had our presentation [ fine, nothing spectacular &#150; for me ] and went to see the car. the customer service rep. pointed out various features [ this is my first bmw ] and set various preferences [ km vs. miles for the trip, etc. ] and we were on our way. [ pictures ] actually just had them park it for another half hour or so, allowing us to peruse their gift shop briefly and pick up a few food & drink items at their caf?, for the afternoon drive. they certainly treat you well and the process is well thought out - and we enjoyed the experience. we could have also done a factory tour and \ or the bmw museum, but i had decided not to do those this time, based on our priorities & our schedule. i had rented a gps \ navigation system with appropriate maps, and the first use was to help me drive out of munich and onto the  audi  heading south and east. worked well here &#150; and several other times, as well. here it was quite helpful in showing what lane[s] to be in before approaching turns, etc. once on the autobahn, i was quite well behaved, speed-wise - even on the few unlimited stretches of this highway &#150; breaking in the new motor & all. my daughter was quite tired and dozed off as we left the  audi  and headed straight south on a12 \ e45 \ e60 toward the austrian border. the navigation system routed us differently than i had expected, and i did not realize it immediately. it also re-routed us a few times around what it saw as traffic congestion [ there was none ] so we were a couple of hours later than expected arriving at the b&b in krimml. a lovely b&b within sight of the falls. had a very good dinner in their rest saturn nt &#150; beer brewed on-site, met my daughter&#146;s approval - and we went to bed.  = = = day 2 &#150; saturday 17 sept. &#150; krimml to verona, italy there had been rain overnight &#150; and there were wispy clouds around the area &#150; with thick overcast. [ pictures ] we had breakfast at about 9 and headed toward the falls. we actually drove past the falls and up to a couple of overlooks [ start of the gerlos pass \ alpine road &#150; pictures ] and then drove back down to park and hike in. the sun came out brilliantly as we started the trek.  the hike up to various views of the falls was fairly steep, but the scenery was quite spectacular. [ pictures ] after we finished the hike, we stopped at their caf? for coffee and an apple strudel. excellent! we stopped back in the village to just stroll around for a while, just enjoying the ambiance. then we were off &#150; heading up to the gerlos pass. the sun was out and we stopped several times to just enjoy the views. just after passing the summit [ and paying the toll ] we pulled off at a tiny [ closed ] &#145;kiosk&#146; and scenic v toyota a &#150; lovely lake and glaciers above. [ pictures ] descending, there was just no where that i could pull over \ off the road to safely stop. and the road demanded attention. the views were often stunning &#150; and the road was in excellent shape [ as were most roads we encountered in austria ] and i just needed to pay attention. my daughter really enjoyed the views! heading back north toward the a12 \ e60 we encountered some sort of festival [ in stumm or fugen? ] that involved cows with elaborate &#145;headdresses&#146;. un toyota ue in my experience. and we stopped at a mcdonalds for a quick bite of lunch. odd to see their take on menu, etc. and my daughter bought something [ delicious ] from a trailer parked in the lot next door. we hit the highway, toward innsbruck, turned south and crossed into italy. this is where we encountered the first real issue of the trip. i had not done sufficient research to realize that the area from before trento to verona was as industrialized as it was. my bad. i had expected to be able to simply [ ? ] pick an exit off the highway and find a hotel or b&b to stay for the night. this turned out to be a very bad idea. long [ and winding = narrow switchbacks, in the dark ] story short: we finally asked a toll-taker at an exit in verona for a recommendation at about 9pm, and stayed at a hotel just off the highway. very basic, small rooms, but adequate & inexpensive.  = = = day 3 &#150; sunday 18 sept. &#150; verona to la spezia we had a surprisingly good breakfast at the hotel and then headed south, toward la spezia. this drive was relatively uneventful, until it started to rain. the highway was well worn [ tire ruts ] in spots and even with brand new michelins, there were times when i felt it prudent to slow somewhat. and the gps \ nav again became confused &#150; taking us on a more circuitous route [ even narrower and more winding ] than necessary from la spezia to pitelli. really, really narrow streets.  car  parked on either side. raining. not confident of the nav system&#146;s routing &#150; somewhat stressful. but we did arrive &#150; and not too late = 4:30 or so in the afternoon.  after settling in, we asked about a place to have dinner. a few mis-communications and assumptions and much walking later [ and rather wet ] we managed to have pizza at the only place in the village that was actually open at about 6 or 7 on a sunday evening.  it rained, often quite hard, and was quite windy until 3 or 4 am. then cleared and calmed.  = = = day 4 & 5 &#150; monday & tuesday 19, 20 sept. &#150; cinque terre continued... "
rayainsw,11-Oct," day 4 & 5 &#150; monday & tuesday 19, 20 sept. &#150; cinque terre i had decided early on [ for several reasons ] that we would park the car at the b&b and leave it there until we left on thursday. we took a bus to la spezia and then the train to each of the villages &#150; bus stop right across from the b&b. i will not detail everything here. suffice to say that the scenery and the town buildings are everything we expected, and even more! the color of the water was striking &#150; and the surf generated by the overnight storm added interest and texture. beautiful. [ pictures ] the high temperatures were a bit warmer than is typical for this time of year all 3 days &#150; but cool each morning, for breakfast outside on the deck. we had gelato each day we stayed here. in fact twice one day - outstanding!! the lunch each day in the different villages was quite good. and the sight-seeing was just amazing.  = = = day 6 &#150; wednesday 21 sept. - s. terenzo and lerici. the woman who runs the b&b where we were staying suggested that we would enjoy spending some time walking through these two local villages. we did. interesting architecture. beautiful old church &#150; castles &#150; lovely. and we had a very good lunch right at the harbor. i&#146;m guessing we walked over 4 miles this day &#150; much of it up and down the hills. but worth every step. day 7 &#150; thursday 22 sept. &#150; la spezia to s. bernadino, switzerland  despite our prior experience, we decided to try the same strategy that had blown up in our faces before &#150; meaning: look for a place to stay for the night, off the highway, once well into switzerland. circling around   mercury   to the southeast, we headed toward como. again, the v toyota as were lovely, but safely pulling off the road to stop and really enjoy them was problematic.[ pictures ] at one point [ perhaps near chiavenna? ] my daughter noted that one of several waterfalls [ dropping hundreds of feet from the peaks on either side of he road that wound up the valley floor ] looked like we might be able to exit and drive back to see it somewhat closer. she was correct [ that happened a lot ] and it was well worth the slight &#145;detour&#146;. [ pictures ] we ended up staying at an exquisite little hotel in san bernardino. just before the entrance to the san bernardino tunnel, this a tiny old village &#150; primarily geared to skiing. we were &#145;off-season&#146; and the town was very quiet. the water in the creek running through town was clear. the air was crisp, cool and clear. just lovely. we had excellent fondue for dinner in the hotel&#146;s rest saturn nt and slept well &#150; enjoying the fresh mountain air &#150; at over 5,000 feet elevation.  day 8 &#150; friday 23 sept. s. bernardino to memmingen, germany we had another excellent breakfast [ more wonderful bread ] at the hotel and headed north. on the autobahn [ 96 \ e54 \ e43 ] approaching memmingen, i had my one opportunity to briefly explore the outer limits of [ my experience in ] legal, very high speed driving. a break in traffic [ friday pm ] allowed a quick blast to 135+ mph. exhilarating. but traffic again intervened and i was back to 100 &#150; 115, or so on most of the unlimited sections. this was also the case the next day, saturday, going to the munich airport &#150; generally able to hold a steady 100, with a few blasts to 115 or so &#150; then back to 100. holding 115 mph for a few minutes at one point was quite satisfying. being passed while doing 100 mph by porsches [ and others, but most often porsches ] clearly doing 140, 150 mph or more was quite an experience as well! we arrived in memmingen in time to spend a few hours exploring the old  honda  area, town square, churches, etc. we ate dinner at the hotel - very good. day 9 = final day &#150; saturday 24 sept. &#150; memmingen to munich airport and fly back to boston we slept well, until a local, nearby church rang the &#147;100 o&#146;clock&#148; bells. the ringing just kept on and on &#150; at 7am. oh, well &#150; time to rise and shine. another very traditional breakfast at the hotel, an hour or so at the farmers&#146; market in the town square [ best looking produce and fruit i have ever seen ! ] and we packed up for the last leg of our  dodge . we drove to a car wash, then to a final fuel stop [ ended with exactly the quarter tank the shipper recommends ] and drove to the airport to drop the car off, and [ after waiting in several lines, including 2 security checkpoints, since we were flying to the us ] we flew home without incident. a few overall impressions: this was a wonderful trip. it is hard to describe the feeling of driving for miles through what looks like the biggest postcard in the world. large areas of both switzerland and austria were absolutely magnificent and spectacular.  cinque terre was all we had hoped. we spent 2 full days exploring and enjoying all 5 towns and it was amazing. the other 2 small villages we visited near the b&b on our third day there were a charming surprise as well. the times i was stressed were mostly a result of no experience driving anywhere in europe and knowing very little german or italian. [ meaning, mostly my fault. ] i do not expect to return to europe anytime in the next few years [ if ever ] and my daughter had downloaded a translation app. for both italian and german - so did not expend a lot of time or effort trying to learn the languages. some of the country and village roads in italy were scary narrow. and i wish they had the option to just buy a sticker for use of their toll roads. my one &#145;incident&#146; [ scraped the left front rim ] was while struggling to deal with an un-attended toll booth at an exit somewhere south of trento after dark. i drove too close to the curb, trying to understand and deal with the instructions and reach the ticket \ credit card slots, etc. [ sigh ] oh, well. why not rome or florence or   mercury   or venice, one might ask? my daughter spent over a week in italy a couple of years ago, and had an opportunity to visit each of those places. and i was just personally much more interested in the austrian and swiss alps and the italian mediterranean coast than the cities. we were both quite happy with our choices! the car &#150; 2011  bmw s coupe, le mans blue, gray leather, dct, premium package,  toyota  access, heated front  seat , satellite radio. http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/car/10 audi /2011_bmw_ bmw s-short_take_road_test- -  i test drove 2  car  equipped essentially identical to what i bought, except they both had the optional 19&#148; wheels & tires. for me & for my typical driving, i decided that the 18s would be fine &#150; and offer a somewhat better ride. the car was delivered with michelin  honda s &#150; excellent tires.  continued...

markcincinnati,11-Oct," no, it takes one day to install the back-up sensors. i live in cincinnati, the purchasing dealer (where i also purchased the sensors from, and incorporated them into the lease now that they can be capitalized) is in columbus.100 miles separate these cities.i travel every saturday to columbus. the arrangement was this -- drop off the car, pick up the loaner, then pick up the car the following saturday. this, for better or worse, gives me the use of the  acura  for about a week.i am able to note the acura upgrades to what is essentially a honda of some kind (people here say it is an  honda ). the fit and finish and the interior are certainly somewhat upgraded over what you would get in a honda.but, despite these upgrades and the requirements for premium fuel, the  acura  doesn't, to me, represent an entry into the ellps crowd. but, as i  toyota d, live and let live, keep it in and we'll see what happens.i would think that the  acura  would be   ""  kia hyundai naturally  ""  kia hyundai  cross-shopped with an audi  audi  -- for instance. but, as i  toyota d, i cross shopped a 2012 tl sh-awd advance with an audi  audi  2.0t prestige tiptronic and, for fun, i drove a premium plus s4, more or less stripped of the lux bits and w/o the sport differential (torque vectoring). also, i shopped the acura against a cts/4 luxury edition w/19  ""  kia hyundai  wheels and paddle shifters as well as against a volvo  volvo  t6 and against an infiniti  infiniti x/s and an  bmw 7x premium+tech. having just come from a 2008 bmw (my wife's), i did not look at a 3 series, my german preferences satisfied with the  audi  and/or s4.to me, these cross shopping ad toyota s seem mostly rational (the  bmw 7x is an outlier) -- i would not have considered a  acura  anymore than i would have considered an  audi , for instance.i drove my 2009  audi  prestige with the 19  ""  kia hyundai  sport package to work, yesterday -- today i drove the  acura  in. i would say the differences were like filet mignon vs l saturn 's lean hamburger patties. i like both of them, but prefer the filet, by far.i did test drive both of the audis and the acura on the same saturday in june -- i also test-drove the cts i mentioned. the acura was, best i can describe, like an audi as4  audi  if such a model actually ex toyota ed.anyway, sorry to digress -- again -- but the back-up sensors are not taking this long, the issue is where i live vs where i bought. once the sensors are in, i will either use a cincinnati acura dealer for service or i will take advantage of lindsay acura's saturday service for things like oil changes and tire rotation, etc. "

graphicguy,11-Oct," nyc.....i've made a couple of stabs at testing a g. they're good  car . they kind of cover the gamut. the  infiniti  targets the  acura , probably an  audi  and a  bmw . the  infiniti  seems to target  bmw . i believe the tl sh awd is up the ladder a little from the g, however. while the  infiniti  is fast, i feel my  bmw  is faster with more neutral handling and a better ride. refinement in both the tl and the 3 are much higher than in the g.so, as mentioned before, the g tries to cover a lot of ground.my fear (and one of the main reasons i bought the '11 3) is that bmw is moving towards 4 cyl motors, at least in the lower 3s and 5s. nothing inherently wrong with that. audi's been doing that for years with their  audi . but, some of us feel at that price point, a 6 cyl is the least we'd accept.mark...i tried to find an s4 at both the audi connection and in dayton. all they had were used ones. as you say, you get about 95%+ of an s4 in the tl sh awd, for a whole lot less money. interesting enough, the cincinnati audi dealer never seems to have much in the way of new  car ....a few  audi s, a few  audi s....one  audi  and a splattering of the qs. nothing that gra toyota ed me. and, i went there probably 3-4 times over a 3-4 month period. the guys at beechmont had 3-s4s, and a whole lot of  audi s, but i just couldn't bring myself to pay a premium over my tl sh awd when push came to shove.now, if either of them had stocked an  audi  or s5 (which they didn't), my decision might have been different. the only  audi s they had were convertibles and i don't think the new s5 was out yet. "
markcincinnati,11-Oct," the audi connection, in particular, seems to be adopting (not voluntarily) the european (at least the german) way of buying a car: visit dealer, look at the model you are interested in, get a brochure, place an order, wait. no instant gratification there -- here, on the other hand, we decide,   ""  kia hyundai let's go buy a new car. . .today!

markcincinnati,11-Oct," the  infiniti , from a performance perspective, is more comparable to the 335, not the 328.go on-line to infiniti and select a  infiniti  or 37x (and you can, if you like even go for the   ""  kia hyundai s  ""  kia hyundai  models). crank the options to 11 and you will find the g remains available with an msrp that begins with a   ""  kia hyundai $4  ""  kia hyundai  -- with a 328hp engine and premium package, navigation package, sport package, technology package, interior  hyundai s packge, rear decklid spoiler and midnight black grille package,  suzuki  guards, stainless steel il chevrolet ted kick plates, led daytime running lights and interior  hyundai  lighting all for an msrp of: $46,940. this car imho is not comparable to a bmw 328.now, i am not in any way suggesting that the bmw is not a   ""  kia hyundai superior  ""  kia hyundai  vehicle (car & driver, despite loving the g, loves the bmw even more). many magazine writers do opine that infiniti's  infiniti  and  infiniti x are japanese bimmer competitors, but they almost always place the g in the #2 spot.well, hell, try to equip the comparable bmw 3 (which has to be a 335) at the level of the g above -- it can't be done if one of the constraints is   ""  kia hyundai to keep the bmw's msrp under $50,000.

m6user,11-Oct, just did a quick build on each website and the 328xi comparably equipped(as i could get) was about $5k more than the  infiniti x. plus you get the +100hp to boot with the g. the 328 may be a little better driver and smoother runner but for value it's hard to beat the g. infinitis are extremely reliable and trouble free for the most part. i have one(qx4) that is 9 years old and it has had only two repairs(exhaust resonator and power antenna) other than scheduled maint. 
smarty666,11-Oct," nah, they are taking 4k off a fully loaded  infiniti  at my two local infiniti dealers and i'll bet it is similar in discounts your received on your  bmw  so the g still in all trims is a better bang for your buck then the  bmw . also a  infiniti  is fully loaded with nav, sport, etc for around 44k, before any discounts. it still undercuts the  bmw  in price. as almost all the  bmw  my local bmw has are priced in the high 40s to low 50s. the g even undercuts that price. i'm not saying the  bmw  or  bmw  are bad vehicles, in fact i really liked them when i test drove both but they still don't compare to the bang for buck of g.

flightnurse,11-Oct," i think you are assuming too much, each region is completely different when it comes to discount, rebates, leases and equipment. i know here on the west side of the country infiniti is hurting for  car , so discounts are far and few. so when i do a comparison its done with the fact of what the prices were i live. the base price for a  infiniti  is $36k, and it does not come with nav, now to add the tech package to get nav and sport package is $41k. this was more then my 328 with m sport package. the  infiniti  sport is 41k.. just for the record my bmw is  bmw  with m sport package, with value package which includes leather, ipod connection (free) moonroof, and access entry, cost out the door was $37k. this includes 4yr 50k of free maintenance and service, i tend to run my  bmw  hard and go through brakes, the clutch is covered under  bmw  warranty so if needed, i wont have to pay anything, something infiniti does not do.

markcincinnati,11-Oct," this thread is more than a tad interesting since i, for one and apparently more than one, seem to find some surprise that the  acura  and a 3 series bmw (even though it is the   ""  kia hyundai bad  ""  kia hyundai  one) merit cross-shopping.the tl sh-awd seems like the obvious choice to cross shop an awd bmw 3 series with, assuming one must cross shop an acura and a bmw.but, of the choices offered up in this thread, i would find the audi 2.0t  audi  with the pre-paid maintenance (or perhaps the volvo  volvo  t6) to be even more of an apples-to-apples comparison worthy of cross-shopping. then i look at my recent purchase of a tl, after 29 audis in a row, and knowing what i cross shopped, well maybe i see the rationale of shopping for both a bmw 3 x-drive and a tl sh-awd (but never a  acura .)having had three awd bmw's since 1988 (in addition to the 29 audi's), there is no comparison between the bmw and the  acura  in terms of the   ""  kia hyundai feel-behind-the-wheel  ""  kia hyundai  -- and, moreover, in winter, four driven wheels are much better than two, even if those two are the fronts.although not comparable to the bmw in terms of the   ""  kia hyundai ultimate driving experience  ""  kia hyundai  the tl sh-awd does a better imitation of an audi  audi  2.0t  audi  prestige than any other japanese car i test drove. in fact the tl sh-awd advance (which adds 19  ""  kia hyundai  wheels and tires) actually felt pretty competent compared with an 2011 audi s4 premium+.given the two choices you offered up for us to weigh in on, the  acura  is only comparable to the bmw in that they both have four wheels -- the bmw is that much better. :confuse: "

renssils,11-Oct," after driving my 2012 acura tl sh-awd with advance package and automatic transmission for 8,000 miles, i can make a few observations. the car has been reliable, though lately it rattles, perhaps from the sunroof. the  seat  are  toyota able. the hvac and in-car electronics are excellent. on the highway it gets about 27 miles a gallon; in town, about 17 miles a gallon. the engine and transmission are both quiet and smooth.within 250 miles of my getting the tl at the end of april 2011, i bought a set of four continental contiextreme dw summer tires, which are so much better than the oem goodyear tires. the tl on the conti tires is fun to drive! the contis stick like glue, are quieter, and smoother riding. today in anticipation of winter, the goodyears were installed on the tl; the contis will be stored until next april. i will miss the contis. i recall that the goodyear tires were noisy, rough riding, and had low limits of adhesion. i hope that they'll perform well in shallow snow.i've owned several high-performance all-wheel-drive  sedan  including a 2001 audi  audi  4.2 sport, a subaru svx, which is my all-time favorite, and two subaru  subaru  spec.b  sedan . i was inclined to get a new audi s4, but chose the tl after driving a bmw  bmw x, volvo  volvo  t6, and infiniti  bmw 7x. the tl seemed to be the best all-around vehicle. the tl was appreciably less costly to lease than the other  car . the tl delights in many ways, but disappoints in some ways. the forward visibility is atrocious. thick, raked a-pillars create huge blind spots; turning left or right always seems risky. rear visibility is severely limited. the back up camera has primitive software and furthermore rain on the camera's lens reduces its utility. the trunk is oddly shaped and small for a 194-inch long car; if you don't lift the trunk deck as high as it will go, its pointed bottom lip will stab you. the only clock is an inch-long digital display buried in a panel near the radio buttons. the navigation system's system has irritating quirks that should have debugged long ago. the car would benefit from a reduction in window and road noise.the tl is so close to being a fine car, but i wouldn't buy it or any car ever again with small windows, high belt line, and atrocious visibility.

markcincinnati,11-Oct," i have about a half a dozen dvd audio disks, and you are right -- wow! my outgoing 2009  audi  prestige had the b&o system and it was great, too, but nothing like the acura els system in dolby plii or dvd-audio (or dts cd's for that matter, too.)i wonder why, in this day and age of branding, that acura chose not to have a tie in with a name brand sound system?

kdshapiro,11-Oct," i guess it depends. i have a number of bose products and are very happy with them.we are talking about stock stereo systems. based on the source i suspect there will be a lot of v honda bility. the only thing is acura can play dvd-a discs, which, imo is going the way of cassette. it is debateable if there is a real world difference between a dvd-a disc at 96khz and a dvd disc at 48khz.

kdshapiro,11-Oct," what is debateable and what i was getting at, is can you hear the difference at 65 mph over rough, noisy pavement? between the two formats. i'll bet not.i'm not talking about a high-end home theater system, i'm talking about wind noise, road noise, rain noise all at once. "

shipo,11-Nov," from my perspective, the horsepower race has gotten out of hand and now even the lowest power  bmw  is more than powerful enough even if other similar sized vehicles offer more power for less money.to underscore that point, my 2002 530i 5-speed was just about as perfect a car for my needs, wants, and desires from a size, power, feature, and performance perspective as there could ever be, and the new  bmw  will (or should) have a tad more space inside, weigh about the same, have considerably more power, perform even better, get better fuel economy, and cost less. could it be that the new  bmw  6-speed with the 2.0 liter blown mill will be even more perfecter for me than my  bmw ? from everything i've seen and read about the f30, it definitely looks like that may be the case. :shades: "

kdshapiro,11-Nov," the 530 manual was the epitome of what represented a bmw. however, time marches on and things change. bmw has had to change with the times.this new 328 hopefully will usher bmw into a new era for the 3 series. i really like the styling, hits the nail right on the head. "
kdshapiro,11-Nov, i disagree with you. if you would like to explain your position instead of posting a drive-by shot at infiniti please feel free to do so. 
markcincinnati,11-Nov," our first and only infiniti, thus far, is a 2011. i cannot speak to or about what has gone before. between my wife and i, we have had 29 audis, 3  volkswagen 's 3 bmw's, 1 infiniti and 1 acura. i would say based on our ownership experiences and our many, many test drives, that your comment about infiniti's mission statement has to be based on something you read (but not much) or some personal experience (?) you may have had sometime in the past -- or else you're just poking the fire for whatever reason.i would say, at this point in my experience, that infiniti is the japanese bmw (praise for the infiniti, that is) and that acura is the japanese audi (praise primarily for acura but actually some praise back at audi, too.)courser engines? well, at their rpm limits, infiniti engines are not quite up to the bmw reputation of silky smoothness, but i would not think this is part of any kind of a mission statement. as to the comment jerky rides -- i will simply have to write that off as most likely coming from a position of ignorance or con ford . :confuse: "
shipo,11-Nov," while i agree that the   ""  kia hyundai gotta have it  ""  kia hyundai  crowd buys a car for its specifications as written, some of us still buy a car for how well it fits the mission we're buying it for. when i bought my 530i it was the first time in my life i didn't opt for the largest/most powerful engine available for the model i was buying. i considered a 540i 6-speed, but given how powerful and balanced the 530i was, i just couldn't justify the extra $8,000 (apples to apples).given that the f30  bmw  will weigh roughly 200 pounds less than my e39 530i, have (depending upon the source) anywhere from 20 to 40 more horsepower and 45 to 60 more pound-feet of torque, one might make the case that the f30  bmw  will be able to give an e39 540i 6-speed a run for its money. in my mind, other than the paper specifications of the  bmw  and  bmw  versus the competition, the new baby  bmw  is, if anything, too powerful (not that i'm going to complain mind you).

billyperksii,11-Nov," the point i was trying to make is- infiniti is spending so much time chasing bmw that they are getting left behind in the dust. secondly, i base my buying on my own experience with the car and the features that fits my needs. not like the gullible ones that goes by what some magazine articles states. i say this all the time, back in 2000 when i graduated college, i got a decent job in a brokerage shop making a relatively good salary. i wanted a car and saw the mazda millennia, every research i did gave the car thumbs down. me and my infinite wisdom test drove the car for about 2 hours- car was incredible and gave zero  problem  for the 36 months that i leased it.i have no  problem  with infiniti, i wanted the fx when they first came out, i went the nyc auto show to check it out and it was a big disappointment in terms of rear space accommodations. i wanted the  pontiac 5x, same problem-space and in addition that awful growl that invades the cabin.the tl has been very very good in the 27 months of ownership, the next stop for me are the germans-if acura upgrades the rl to a v8, i will stick with the brand. here is the short l toyota  for next car hunt-e550 4matice63 (depends on the bonus and incremental base pay increase)550 xiwhat do you think sweenydog?????

kdshapiro,11-Nov," having just bought a  infiniti , i spent a week with it on a trip. i'm not impressed with acura tl, they have not really moved forward in few years. and while i did a boat load of driving and looking, my wife and i were on the same page regarding the acura, just no interest.the cabin was too big for me along with the turning radius.the  infiniti  is a very compelling package. a fully loaded car, except the tech package cost me what a basic 335 would have been.

markcincinnati,11-Nov," didn't forget them at all . . . just thought my [subjective] point had been made. hell, i grew up where only rich people's  car  had a/c and power windows. my dad got a new plymouth in 1969 with power steering -- but no power brakes. and even though it was the top of the line plymouth satellite with a 318 v8 (the 383 and hemi were reserved for the road runner and the 440 was for the gtx), it didn't have factory air -- so my dad had the dealer install aftermarket a/c which meant the front bench seat could only seat two instead of three because of the   ""  kia hyundai device  ""  kia hyundai  (the blowing unit) that was installed that stuck way out into the passenger area.the first time i got a car with power steering, brakes and windows, i knew i had become a member of   ""  kia hyundai the club.

markcincinnati,11-Nov," you may be right about your longevity concern -- i really don't know. what i have read, however, is that the full stop, engine shut off, then engine restart when   ""  kia hyundai the light changes  ""  kia hyundai  will save countless gallons of fuel once this tech is widespread.perhaps there is little to be concerned with about the engine -- i would, however, wonder if the constant restarting of the engine would not be hard on the starter motor?in any case, i assume this auto shut off will be placed in widespread use as we strive to save every drop of fuel we can by almost any and every means even remotely possible.somewhere i read that there is a patent on a technology that   ""  kia hyundai warms up  ""  kia hyundai  the transmission when the car is started cold; this warm transmission apparently yields a bit more mpg's, and, over the life of the car, this   ""  kia hyundai bit more  ""  kia hyundai  adds up. it is especially interesting when one extrapolates this to millions of  car  and finds that the annual savings ends up being a governmental sum of money and fuel saved (so they say.)fuel saving tires have been in production and use for years (you can tell i watch too much tv) -- even though the savings per car are only a few drops of fuel annually (but again when extrapolated to millions of  car , these drops become a big deal and big bucks.)mostly (which is not the same as entirely) i am for virtually all new technolgies and also for the upgrading of   ""  kia hyundai older  ""  kia hyundai  technologies to make them   ""  kia hyundai better  ""  kia hyundai  (and greener, too, if possible). when a new technology is found to be wasteful, harmful or just plain inappropriate though, i am all for scrapping it, beginning a new project or exploring a new idea and moving forward. :surprise: "

shipo,11-Nov," regarding the whole start/stop thing while sitting stopped at a light or some such, i don't think it will affect engine longevity at all. why? because the bulk of engine wear comes when cold starting an engine where the lubricant has had a considerable amount of time to drain down into the sump; a couple of minutes at a light just isn't all that long in the grand scheme of things.other fuel economy related thoughts:i find the concentration on things like transmission oil temperatures for improving fuel economy curious, and if i might be so bold, highly questionable. from my perspective, for a relatively modest investment (compared to the potential gain), it makes sense to me to harvest the latent heat radiating off the exhaust system to power the various subsystems of the vehicle. i'm thinking there is many-many times the necessary power lost in the form of radiated heat to drive the electricals, the power ass toyota  pumps, the a/c compressor, and even the valve train (electrically or hydraulically).remove the mechanical load of all of those components from the engine and fuel economy should easily see a double-digit percentage gain. the only company which has announced such a research project is bmw; hopefully it will become a reality sooner than later.
